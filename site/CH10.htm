  <h2>CONGO PAST AND PRESENT </h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/6.jpg" width="300" height="228" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>Before 1885 Congo
      was a vast country of numerous tribes with many languages and customs
      all different from each other. David Livingstone, great Protestant
      missionary and explorer, supposed to be lost in Central Africa, was
      found by Henry M. Stanley. This contact resulted in world interest
      in the Congo country. Stanley looked for some government to develop
      the strange land. He found nobody who cared except King Leopold II
      of Belgium, who wanted a colony. He and others in 1885 organized the
      Congo Free State which in reality became a tremendous private domain
      with Leopold as sovereign. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">As the years passed
      and exports from the Free State grew, news reached the outside world
      that all was not well with the Congo. <a href="Pictures/af16.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/af16.jpg" width="300" height="257" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>There was world-wide criticism
      of Leopold's regime. It was then decided that Belgium should take over
      jurisdiction in Congo, and what had been the Congo Free State became
      a colony of the Belgian nation. A Charte Coloniale was given the Congo
      by the government of Belgium in 1908. That Charter created the colony
      to be known for 52 years as the Belgian Congo. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Under stress of international
      pressures from without, and some Congolese leaders from within, Belgium
      in 1960 surprised the world by granting independence to its former
      colony. Most of the Congolese people, and many people in Belgium also,
      were surprised. No battle was fought to win independence. Belgium voluntarily
      gave freedom to the peoples of Congo to avoid a long and bloody struggle
      such as preceded independence in some other lands. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/22.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/22.jpg" width="300" height="223" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>But the independence
      came suddenly to a people who were not prepared for it. Elections
      were quickly arranged for multitudes of people who had never voted
      in their lives. A hastily organized nation came into being. The takeover
      was peaceable, but in a few weeks the army mutinied, and intertribal
      wars began which horrified the world. The United Nations with an international
      military force intervened. Some of that force still remains in Congo
      as this is written. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">It is more than three
      years since Congo Belge became the REPUBLIQUE DU CONGO. Its brief history
      has been troubled by the efforts of some provinces to secede from the
      Central Government. The secessions have been prevented by action of
      the United Nations. As a result the Republique du Congo is still in
      control of a sort over the whole great land. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/rc31.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/rc31.jpg" width="300" height="256" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>The conflicts between
      the Province of Katanga on one side, and the United Nations and the
      Leopoldville government on the other, plus numbers of intertribal wars
      in many areas, did great damage. They resulted in the destruction of
      many of the physical benefits brought to Congo by the Belgians. Railroad
      property suffered tremendous losses. Important bridges were blown up.
      River ferries were put out of commission. Railroad service was disorganized
      or stopped entirely. Highways built at great expense were made impassable.
      Many villages were burned and hundreds, probably thousands, of people
      were massacred. Many of the foreigners left the country in terror. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The business sections
      and some of the residence sections of prosperous cities became virtual
      ghost towns. In some places there was wholesale looting of mercantile
      establishments and private residences. Thousands of automobiles abandoned
      by Europeans were appropriated by natives who drove them until gas
      ran out or the cars were wrecked. Robbery was common.<a href="Pictures/rc32.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/rc32.jpg" width="300" height="258" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a> Breakdown of
      communications and transport and finance left thousands of people hungry,
      and many starving. Foreign organizations, including the United Nations
      and Red Cross and some Church organizations, imported food for the
      hungry refugees by any means available. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The well-organized
      medical services of the government and missionary organizations nearly
      ceased to function. In some places this was due to the evacuation of
      the foreign staff and the expulsion of trained medical assistants who
      came from distant tribes. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The number of displaced
      persons multiplied into thousands and thousands as well-established
      and profitably employed people were forced to leave their homes and
      flee to their ancestral areas. Often they found no place to go as their
      old homes and sometimes the whole towns they originally came from had
      disappeared entirely. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/72.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/72.jpg" width="300" height="328" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>From some of these
      fearful experiences the Congo cannot recover for many years, even under
      the most favorable circumstances. Villages built of temporary materials
      can in some places be constructed in weeks or months, if the seasons
      are favorable. But replacing bridges and ferries, boats, and permanent
      buildings costs money, and the destruction of so many other things
      has indeed "killed the goose that laid the golden eggs." What was in
      days or weeks or months destroyed may not be entirely replaced in the
      lifetime of anyone now living. Poverty is still the lot of most of
      the people, hunger is common, and the discouragement resulting from
      all the aforesaid events prevents all too many people from using the
      resources still remaining to improve their pitiful condition. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">We were missionaries,
      sent to Congo by the American Presbyterian Congo Mission, which began
      its work back in 1891 in the days of the Congo Free State. It continued
      from 1908 until 1960 under the jurisdiction of the Belgian Congo. After
      a brief evacuation in July 1960 it has continued its work under the
      Republique du Congo. More of that will be considered later. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/73.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/73.jpg" width="300" height="348" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>It is to be understood
      that our Mission never interfered in the politics of the Belgians or
      of the Congolese. Its work has been entirely a mission of mercy under
      the Great Commission left by Jesus Christ to His Church, to heal and
      to teach and preach the Gospel. In its educational, medical, and evangelistic
      work it has pursued its course, recognizing the "powers that be" as
      being ordained of God. We have conformed to the lawful authority of
      the government in power as best we could. We taught the people to pay
      their taxes, to respect and obey the government, both their own chiefs
      and the foreigners recognized as rulers over the chiefs. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">There is a parallel
      to all this in the New Testament. Jesus Christ Himself, coming with
      a message from God to the Jewish people, found them a subject nation,
      under the control of the Romans as we found the Congolese under the
      control of Belgium. So we felt justified in keeping hands off political
      matters as He did in His day. We had no commission from our God nor
      from His Church to liberate the Congolese peoples from a colonial government.
      Our duty clearly was, "submit yourselves to every ordinance of man
      for the Lord's sake." </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">But for the limitations
      and prohibitions of our commission it might have been natural for Americans
      to have educated Congolese people for republican government such as
      we believed in. <a href="Pictures/71.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/71.jpg" width="300" height="414" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>If we had done that, Congo might not have found itself
      short of men trained for government office when the time of need so
      surprisingly and so suddenly arose. But if we had disobeyed our own
      commission and engaged in such activities we would certainly and without
      delay have been expelled from the colony. Thus we would have lost our
      opportunity to preach the Gospel to the Congo people. In being loyal
      to the Belgian Colonial Government we were without a doubt doing our
      duty. </p>
  <h3>The Abdication of King Baudouin. </h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">June 30, 1960, was
      set as the great day for the inauguration of independence. A formal
      ceremonial was arranged at Leopoldville where Baudouin officially handed
      over his authority as King of Belgian Congo to Patrice Lumumba, the
      new Prime Minister representing the people of the former colony. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Independence was a
      time of joyful celebration which the people welcomed, but which most
      of them did not understand. Multitudes throughout Congo shouted for
      independence without knowing what it meant. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">But peace and joy
      were not for long. Before the new republic could settle down to enjoy
      independence the army mutinied, and nearly destroyed the new nation.
      Struggles for power began involving personal, and also tribal, grasping
      for the reins of authority over the nation's people and the nation's
      wealth. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Powerful leaders arose
      supported by financial and political power from outside of Congo. Both
      Lumumba and his enemies had support from mighty interests within and
      outside of the United Nations. Congo came all too close to falling
      into the total control of atheistic communist nations, which would
      have terminated missionary work within the country.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The United Nations, sharply divided between communist
    and free nations, intervened in Congo to end the tribal wars which threatened
    to destroy everything worth while in the land. For about three years
    soldiers of the United Nations, from many countries, have been stationed
    in Congo, and have even fought in Congo, to secure peace. It is not yet
    clear when or whether this military occupation will end. </p>
  <h3>Evacuation by Missionaries.</h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Within a month after
      Independence Day, fighting within the Congo became so fierce that the
      American State Department, under whose passport protection Americans
      were present in Congo, ordered the evacuation of American missionaries.
      This seemed impossible. Roads were closed in many areas, and our missionaries
      were cut off from avenues of escape. United States transport planes
      could reach a few large airfields in Congo. But most of our people
      were trapped on their own stations. Prompt action by two missionaries
      with light airplanes succeeded in carrying all missionaries to points
      where they could embark in large American planes for Rhodesia, south
      of the Congo. There was great confusion within the Congo, and nobody
      could predict what would happen. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">From the time of their
      arrival in Rhodesia the missionaries began to study the possibilities
      of return to the people and the work they loved. Seven men were back
      in Congo very soon, scouting by plane to find out when it would be
      wise to return. Soon other missionaries began to return -not all, but
      many of them. </p>
  <h3>After Independence. </h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The missionaries returned
      to a new Congo. They had lived previously in a Belgian Colony. They
      were now returning to the Republique du Congo, no longer a colony,
      but a liberated people. Instead of dealing with Belgian Colonial Territorial
      Agents, Administrators, District Commissioners, Provincial Governors,
      and a supreme Governor General, they found all of these replaced by
      Congolese officials. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In many places there
      was chaos because of intertribal wars and personal struggles for power.
      There have been wars and rumors of wars between provinces and the Central
      Government. There has been international intrigue. There have been
      massacres and wholesale migrations. Oftentimes communications have
      been cut off. Railroad tracks have been torn up or blocked. Radio communications
      have been forbidden. Private transmitters were confiscated. Automobile
      roads were made impassable. Travel across tribal boundaries practically
      came to a stop. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">This is not intended
      to be a history of Congo after independence. Our interest in these
      matters is strictly missionary. We write of wars, political matters,
      and the economic situation, simply as background of the picture of
      missionary affairs. Mignon and I gave the best of our lives to the
      work of Christ in the Belgian Congo from 1917 to 1950 and now we look
      back. What has happened to the work of Missions since? Has the missionary
      work of all the years been destroyed by the coming of independence
      to Congo? </p>
  <h3>Our Work for Christ Has Not Been Destroyed. </h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/74.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/74.jpg" width="300" height="243" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>Even during the period
      of evacuation by the missionaries, some of the work continued. Worship
      services were kept up by Christians in many places. Schools continued
      in many sections. On some stations hospital assistants carried on as
      much healing work as limited supplies and personnel permitted. Church
      leaders carried on as best they could. Reports we have heard indicate
      that Mission property has received better treatment than might have
      been expected. We understand that in general churches and chapels have
      been respected even where villages have been devastated. </p>
  <h3>A New Look at Mission Work.</h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The sudden removal
      of scores of missionaries gave the Congolese people an opportunity
      to decide whether mission work was helpful or harmful to them. Here
      were mission stations. The heart had gone out to them. When the passions
      of the moment born of tribal conflict gave the people any time for
      reflection they could consider what missionaries had done, and had
      not done. They had not engaged in commerce. They had not held government
      offices. They had lived in modest comfort, but not in luxury. Why had
      they been there? They had ministered to the sick. They had taught many
      useful things besides reading, writing, and arithmetic. They had brought
      the people the whole Bible in the Tshiluba language. They had taught
      them beautiful hymns and Gospel songs. As a part of their Gospel of
      salvation they had taught people honesty and fair dealing with one
      another. They had been the friends of the people. Now they were gone. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">If the work of Christian
      missions had been a failure, here was the opportunity of a lifetime
      for Congo's people to get rid of missionaries and missions. Everything
      would now be different. Government was now in their own hands. Congolese
      held all government offices from territorial agent to Prime Minister
      of Congo. Now by refusing re-entry to the evacuated missionaries the
      work of missions could have been ended. But it did not happen. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The latest figure
      available reports that more than seventy missionaries are now on the
      field. Others are on furlough. Work has been resumed on most of the
      stations. <u></u></p>
  <h3>The Congolese People Want the Missionaries. </h3>
<p>  <a href="Pictures/mc1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/mc1.jpg" width="640" height="405" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="center"></a></p><p class="MsoBodyText">The missionaries are
      back again because the people want them back. Without doubt the ministries
      of healing have a share in this. A great medical work had been done
      on our stations. As people in Judea and Galilee long ago flocked around
      Jesus to obtain His healing touch, so people still come to our hospitals
      to be healed. The medical work has suffered by the tribal strife which
      followed independence. A hospital organization is not built in a day.
      It is a team formed by long years of training people in various skills
      which fit together for doing all sorts of things from washing and dressing
      sores to the most serious surgical operations. These groups of workers
      came from various tribes, which have recently been in deadly conflict.
      Many of these workers had to leave their homes and mission stations
      and flee with their families to their own tribal areas. Some of them
      are lost to the medical work. It takes time to rebuild such organizations.
      Some local experienced workers have remained. New help is being trained.
      The work goes on. The people have learned in a new way to appreciate
      what Mission doctors and nurses mean to them. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Mission schools have
      a great share in this new evaluation. Education is appreciated more
      than ever. Many little schools in scores of villages kept going even
      while the missionaries were gone. Thousands of refugees found themselves
      in totally new circumstances and communities. Some of these were students,
      others were teachers. Before the smoke of tribal battles had blown
      away, efforts to establish schools were already in evidence. Some tribes
      had more refugee teachers than other tribes had, therefore were able
      to organize schools more quickly and effectively. All of them began
      to feel more than ever the need for missionary help in education. Missionaries
      were surprised and pleased to find how much of teaching would have
      continued even if the evacuation of foreigners had been permanent. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Admittedly things
      are much disorganized since the coming of independence. Under the Republique
      financial matters have not yet been stabilized. School teachers sometimes
      go for months without pay. Yet teaching continues as best it can. There
      is sound reason to hope that as things settle down under the new government
      school work will be better and better organized. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Our medical work has
      been a vehicle for the Gospel of Jesus. Our educational work has been
      another. Just suppose that these might have gone on by themselves,
      healing and teaching, but with the total elimination of Jesus Christ
      from the whole program, then what? Without the love of Jesus to give
      warmth and motivation, both healing and teaching would have lost their
      value. The very heart of all our missionary work has been the preaching
      and teaching of the Gospel of Jesus. Its inspiration came from Him.
      Our commission came from Him. The question is, has the planting of
      the Gospel seed during the whole period of the existence of the Belgian
      colony left any deposit of spiritual values? Are there any real Christians
      among the Congolese? If the missionaries had not returned, would Jesus
      Christ and His salvation have been forgotten? </p>
  <h3>Many Christians in Congo.</h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/p81.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/p81.jpg" width="300" height="295" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>In fact there are
      many real Christians in Congo. There is a Christian fellowship that
      reaches across tribal boundaries and loves people of enemy tribes just
      because they are fellow Christians. During the days of tribal wars
      and forced evacuation and the loss of all earthly possessions this
      Christian love has been under a terrific strain. Sometimes it has seemed
      to disappear. But beneath all of the stresses there still remains a
      love for Christ and for His people. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Christians are only
      a fraction of the Congolese people. Outside of the Christian fellowship
      there remains bitter tribal hatred creating a poisoned atmosphere which
      to some extent affects even the Christians. Yet in spite of it all
      there still exists that Christian love for the brethren that reaches
      across the walls of separation and is at work to rebuild the Church
      of the Lord Jesus Christ. Outside forces have torn up our Church organization
      and our Mission work in various ways. It will take time to rebuild
      much that was torn down, but the healing of the Church continues. </p>
  <h3>A New Relationship. </h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The whole situation
      of our Mission in Congo is greatly changed. When the work was begun
      in 1891, and until 1908, our missionaries had to adjust to life under
      the Congo Free State. From 1908 until 1960 we had to adjust to life
      in a colony, among a subject people. This affected our operations in
      many ways. Now all that has changed. The Congo is governed by Congolese.
      They are no longer a subject people. In some respects there is a removal
      of restraints, which permits more freedom of action. No longer is there
      conformity to rulings of a colonial administration at Leopoldville
      which in turn was subject to Brussels. Now there are new adjustments
      to entirely different conditions. So many changes are taking place.
      Work of the past decades has raised up a generation of teachers capable
      of taking over the administration and teaching of primary schools.
      But the missionaries are still imperatively needed for high school
      and college and professional education. All these matters call for
      time and patience and love. The work of the missionaries during these
      days of reorganization is not easy. And the work of the Congolese Church
      leaders is not easy. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">All of these arduous
      labors of reorganization and readjustment in Church and school, it
      must be remembered, are proceeding in a country where the government
      itself is being reorganized. It might have been supposed that the new
      government would continue with the same territories and districts and
      provinces which existed in the Colony. But all of the colonial organization
      was imposed by outsiders, and the dividing lines in many cases cut
      right across tribal boundaries. Thus the units were largely artificial.
      Since taking over power the new government has redivided the whole
      Congo into 21 Provinces instead of the former 6. When we remember that
      in the United States with one language it has taken decades for some
      states to redistrict themselves for representation in the state legislatures,
      according to their own constitutions, we can realize that the problem
      of redividing the Congo with scores of tribes and dozens of language
      groups to deal with, must be tremendous. We can see that all of the
      problems of Church organization are made yet more complex by the political
      complications which surround the religious and educational work of
      the Mission. </p>
  <h3>Tribal War at Luebo. </h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">After independence
      the tribal war between the great Baluba and Lulua tribes reached Luebo.
      During the years since 1891 a town of 10,000 people had grown up around
      the Mission station. Most of the people belonged to various branches
      of those two tribes. The town was split wide open. There was fearful
      fighting. Whole sections of the town were burned. Horrible things happened.
      Neither of those tribes owned the land, which had belonged to the Bakete.
      The Baluba outnumbered and outfought the Luluas, and drove them across
      the Lulua River. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Luebo remained a depleted
      town, those remaining being Baluba or their friends. Many Baluba who
      had been scattered in the Lulua country fled to Luebo. The town was
      filled with refugees. Following the evacuation of missionaries from
      the Congo in 1960, the Luebo missionary group scattered. After their
      return to Congo the station sometimes had one missionary, sometimes
      none. Now, three years later, there are six. </p>
  <h3>Mission Press Closed. </h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">For some time the
      Press was closed entirely. Sometimes a group of Congolese printers
      did some printing. But the Press was in a sad state. It seemed as if
      its history of many years of useful work had come to an end. </p>
  <h3>The Mission Press Comes to Life.</h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Before independence
      the women of our Church in America had designated a large share of
      their Annual Birthday Gift for the Mission Press, and for literature
      for the Congo Mission. Providentially the ladies went on with the project
      in spite of the disturbances in Congo. So even when the Press had reached
      its lowest ebb, the offerings in America were collected, and a large
      sum of money became available for an institution that was almost dead. </p>
  <h3>The Vasses Return to the Press. </h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Mignon and I were
      delighted to hear that Lach and Winnie Vass, whose coming to Luebo
      saved the Press from going to pieces in 1942, had returned to Luebo
      twenty years later, to save the Press again. They have returned with
      the benefit of all their many talents, plus sixteen years experience
      in printing and publishing, boundless enthusiasm for the cause of literature,
      and the money needed for expansion. </p>
  <h3>The New Literature Program. </h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The feeling of the
      Mission in regard to literature and the present situation is shown
      by this quotation from a letter of Mr. William Pruitt: </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Our literature program,
      boosted by the Women's Birthday Offering of 1961, is booming. It is
      carried on in conjunction with neighboring missions who also use the
      Tshiluba language. A Scotch couple are now at the Bookstore and book
      warehouse in Luluabourg. A Mennonite is in charge of distribution,
      driving the big bookmobile throughout the countryside, restocking the
      various rural outlets operated by Congolese. Lach and Winnie Vass are
      at the Press, busy with production and editing. Even so we cannot fully
      meet the increasing demand for Christian literature. </p>
  <h3>Letter from Mrs. Vass.</h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">A recent letter from
      Winnie Vass, and the Mission's recently published Annual Report for
      1962, which she also wrote, give additional information from which
      we quote:</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">"You would have to
      be here at Luebo these days to know the fulness of joy and satisfaction
      in our work. All of the new Press equipment which the 1961 Birthday
      Gift of the Women of the Church purchased last year is operating except
      one piece. You should see the crowds of fascinated folk pressing around
      the doors and windows of the Press these days, their mouths agape with
      wonder as they watch the positively uncanny working of the various
      pieces of machinery. One window looks on the paper folder, where the
      pages pass through untouched, folded and folded and folded again, down
      to single page size. The automatic paper cutter just slices down through
      a foot of paper with ease. The Heidelburg Job Press sucks each paper
      up with little red suction cups, feeds it to the proper spot and presses
      the plate down and stacks the forms up on the other side -no hand touching
      them. After years and years (over sixty now) of all our equipment being
      handset, hand fed, and hand operated, this is quite an innovation and
      a thrill! Lach comes home to lunch at noon just elated with the work
      that is being turned out. The one piece of equipment which is still
      not functioning is our Monotype Compositor, which will set type automatically.
      We are still waiting on our order for Monotype metal. When it finally
      does come, then we will be setting the type by machine. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">"The Protestant Bookstore
      of the Kasai, now known all over the Congo, has seen phenomenal growth.
      Total monthly sales until January, 1962, never passed $300.00. By November
      of that year, average monthly sales were well over the $3,000.00 mark.
      [One U.S. dollar = about 50 Congo francs.] </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">"The new edition of
      the hymnal, 20,000 of them, is almost completed, with a supplement
      of 100 new hymns." </p>
  <h3>Successor to the Lomo Loa Bena Kasai.</h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">One of the biggest
      thrills this past month was the completion of the first issue of our
      new Tshiluba periodical, called "Where Are We Going?" It is "Tuyaya
      Kunyi?" in Tshiluba, a catchy title. The first issue turned out beautifully,
      with colored cover and all and we are really proud of it. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The Congolese editor of Tuyaya Kunyi, this new monthly
    magazine, has proven his writing ability by authoring and publishing
    the first complete book by a Kasai Christian.</p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION </h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/sn1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/sn1.jpg" width="300" height="294" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>Our romance has not
      yet ended. Mignon and I are now in our mid-seventies, living in quiet
      retirement at Morristown, Tennessee. We have just celebrated our 48<sup>th</sup> wedding
      anniversary. The lovely lady from Missouri still makes a happy home
      for me in the evening of our life. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Last month we had
      a pleasant surprise. Our nephew, living in Washington, D.C., on August
      11, 1963, wrote to his mother, who passed the word on to us: </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The other day I brought
      a group of students to the President's Press Conference. In front of
      us several colored visitors were speaking French. I leaned over and
      asked them where they were from. One of them answered, "From Belgian
      Congo." I asked him if he was from near Luebo, and he answered that
      was his home town. I told him my uncle was a missionary in the Congo,
      and when I gave him his name he smiled and said, "He is a wonderful
      printer. He has printed many books for us. My father is a minister
      and knows Mr. Longenecker well." He gave his name to me: Kalongi. Uncle
      Hershey might like to know this </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">It is twenty years
      since we left the Mission Press at Luebo, thirteen years since we left
      Congo. We old missionaries are human enough to be thrilled by the assurance
      coming in this roundabout way that we are not yet forgotten in Congo. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">One morning last week
      I waked with the conviction that in closing this book there should
      be mention of something very important. All the years in Congo we have
      lived in the hope of the Second Coming of our Lord Jesus. So we would
      remind our readers of what Jesus said (see Acts 1.8-11 RSV):  "You
      shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you
      shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and
      to the end of the earth. And when He had said this, as they were looking
      on, He was lifted up, and a cloud took Him out of their sight.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">"Behold, two men stood
      by them in white robes, and said, 'Men of Galilee, why do you stand
      looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken from you into heaven,
      will come in the same way as you saw Him go into heaven.'" </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Jesus is coming again!
      ! Are you willing to be His witness, right where you are, or anywhere
      on earth He may choose to send you? </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In my boyhood, before
      I desired or planned to be a missionary, we sang words which may have
      helped to send us to Congo: </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">"It may not be on
      the mountain height, Or over the stormy sea, </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">It may not be at the
      battle front </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">My Lord will have
      need of me; </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">But if, by a still
      small voice He calls To paths that I do not know, </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">I'll answer, dear
      Lord, with my hand in Thine, I'll go where You want me to go." </p>
