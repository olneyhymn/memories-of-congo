                    <h2>SECOND TERM IN CONGO-Continued </h2>
                    <h3>Forced Labor and the Cart. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">The labor situation
                        in Congo was difficult during our term at Bibanga. International exchange
                        had played havoc with the value of money. Industry had not yet adjusted
                        to it. The men who wished to work for the foreigners had all the jobs
                        they wanted. But there were not enough men to meet the demands. The
                        government put into effect what amounted to a rationing of labor. Foreign
                        employers asked for the help they needed, and government officers called
                        on chiefs to provide the needed men. A case in point will show what
                        happened. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Bibanga station had
                        at Lusambo, 160 miles of footpath away, enough of metal roofing to
                        load 400 men. I was not allowed to hire them myself. They had to be
                        asked from the Administrator. He sent to certain chiefs, who sent men
                        to me, and I sent them to Lusambo. I provided them with money to buy
                        food, and paid them for their work when they returned. Some went willingly,
                        others were obliged to go, whether they liked it or not. I was especially
                        unhappy about it because some of the men became ill on the way. One
                        died en route, another returned with smallpox. The whole business was
                        most distressing. I told my fellow missionaries that I could not return
                        to Congo after furlough if I must use forced labor. I was willing to
                        return to preach the Gospel, but not to employ workmen unless employment
                        was one hundred per cent voluntary. While sometimes for certain reasons
                        obligatory recruiting was necessary for other enterprises, in general
                        the Mission has had all the help it needed on a voluntary basis. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">But the foregoing
                        experience forced me to think deeply on the subject of transportation.
                        Roads were being built. However, I knew that the Mission could not
                        afford to use trucks for our transport. With American chauffeurs, I
                        was told, the lifetime of a Model T Ford truck was figured at 8 months.
                        We could not afford trucks at that rate. On the other hand we could
                        not afford missionary time for truck driving. I wondered how our problem
                        could be solved. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">One of the marks of
                        the backwardness of Central Africa before the coming of the white man
                        was that, so far as is known, the people had never learned to use the
                        wheel as an implement for their work. Not even a wheelbarrow was in
                        use among them. And they had no beasts of burden, neither horse, mule,
                        donkey, ox nor camel. When I saw porters returning from a journey with
                        heavy loads, on shoulders sometimes raw, I lay awake at night and worried
                        over the problem. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/9.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/9.jpg" width="300"
                                height="230" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>These loads must be
                        taken off men's shoulders and put on wheels. But how? I designed a
                        two-wheel cart for experimental work by removing and using the wheels
                        of my motorcycle. The cart worked, but was too light to stand the shocks
                        which careless men would be sure to give it. Some of the missionaries
                        helped out with the money to buy a front axle and pair of wheels of
                        a Model T Ford car. By using triangular bracing to lock these wheels
                        in position, it was possible to build a substantial cart. Because the
                        hills were steep and dangerous we needed a strong brake. My design
                        of a very crude brake was not much for looks. But with it one man behind
                        the cart could lift the loaded cart off the ground. This brake served
                        as a drag on the ground, and served us until Mr. Wharton invented a
                        better one. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">A friend of ours,
                        an American mining engineer, to whom I had gone for information about
                        needed Ford parts, told me the cart would not work. He said the natives
                        simply did not have sense enough to operate a cart. The diamond mines
                        had tried one, and found their men unloaded it and carried both the
                        cart and the load over a hill. But we knew better. Our experiment worked,
                        and while it took a great load off the shoulders of the porters, it
                        also took a great load off my mind. </p>
                    <h3>Pounds and Kilograms.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">After the cart had
                        made a successful trip to Luebo, 325 miles away, with four cartmen
                        hauling as much as eight porters would have carried, the men came asking
                        for increased allowance for buying food for the next trip. I told them
                        I was going to pay them by the pound, then they could spend as much
                        of their money for food as they wished. The bigger the load the more
                        money they would receive. They said they didn't want that. They wanted
                        a monthly salary, and increased food allowances. I answered that I
                        would pay only by the pound. A strange misunderstanding put the idea
                        across with a bang. Mr. John Morrison, formerly with the SEDEC at Lusambo,
                        had now come to Luebo as associate Mission Treasurer. From long experience
                        he thought in kilograms, while I thought in pounds. Sending four men
                        with the cart, I asked for a load of 400 pounds. I had set a pound
                        rate which would give the men a little more per pound than our previous
                        costs. If they worked well they could increase their earnings. Mr.
                        Morrison read 400 pounds, but he was <u>thinking </u>400 kilograms,
                        which is 880 pounds, so that is what he gave them. These men came back
                        to Bibanga after a month's absence, and were they angry? It looked
                        as if our transport project was shot. Then I figured their earnings
                        for the trip, and the men were amazed at what they earned. By arranging
                        it so that a man could go on a trip for a month, and stay at home for
                        a month, we soon had all the cartmen we could use. For years this system
                        of transport was used on our stations. The only thing needed to make
                        it work was one change from pounds to kilos, dramatically to prove
                        its advantages to the workmen. </p>
                    <h3>Wagon.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/71.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/71.jpg"
                                width="300" height="414" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>When we
                        built the
                        cart, only dugout canoes were available for crossing the Lubilashi
                        and other rivers. But when ferries were put there for automobiles,
                        I designed a wagon, using Ford front wheels and axles both front and
                        rear. The wheels at the rear were rigidly fixed, while the front wheels
                        turned for guiding the wagon. The man running in front did nothing
                        but lead the wagon. Men at back and sides furnished motive power. As
                        the men's principal food was manioc, these wagons could well have been
                        called manioc motors. When this type of wagon was widely used it gave
                        much satisfaction to those of us who sponsored it. </p>
                    <h3>Preaching.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">It should be remembered
                        that my primary object in going to Africa was to preach the good news
                        of salvation through a crucified Saviour. Though other necessary activities
                        consumed much of my time, they were secondary in importance. Throughout
                        the years I preached as much as I could. In fact the preaching on Sundays
                        was a tonic in my life, and without the recreation of preaching Christ
                        I could never have stayed in Africa. The years at Bibanga gave Sundays
                        free for preaching, and as far as possible I visited a number of villages
                        each Sunday on the motorcycle. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Though it was hard
                        to get away from my many employees on weekdays, I did manage at least
                        three itineration trips during the three years, two of them accompanied
                        by our family. </p>
                    <h3>Hunting Hippos.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/rc17.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/rc17.jpg"
                                width="300" height="396" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>When I was
                        leaving
                        on an itineration without the family, Frank McElroy suggested that
                        I stop at the river crossing to shoot a hippopotamus, sending the meat
                        back home for use in a conference of evangelists. I agreed to try.
                        At the crossing we asked the boatmen whether there were any hippos
                        around. They told us to listen. We could hear the hippos bellowing
                        beyond the bend of the river. So we left the loads and the motorcycle
                        at the crossing, rented canoes, and started up river. As we rounded
                        the bend we could see a number of hippos, as many as seven or eight
                        at a time, swimming in the river, spouting and playing around. I told
                        the boatmen to put me ashore at a place where the dried clay showed
                        the footprints of many hippos. Sitting down on the dry clay I ate lunch
                        and planned strategy. My rifle was too light for hippos. As the hippos
                        were all playing on the other side of the river I decided to get nearer
                        to them. We paddled up river, left the canoes, and walked down the
                        far bank behind the hippos. Look! When we got there the only hippos
                        in sight were right over there where I had eaten lunch. They were playing
                        hide and seek with me. It seemed best to go back to the canoes and
                        float down the river, thus being within shooting range of any hippo
                        I might see. A hippo came up, I fired at him, and registered a hit.
                        He went under, but as we floated along showed up, so I shot him again.
                        Suddenly we had a scare, for a half-grown hippo bobbed up close to
                        our canoes. The men were frightened, and lay down in the canoes. The
                        hippo was scared too, and ducked under the water. Then the men began
                        to laugh at the frightened hippo. Really, it was no laughing matter.
                        We were in danger. Anyone of dozens of hippos might come under us and
                        dump us in the deep river, and kill us with their tusks, or watch us
                        drown. However, we kept floating down river, and the wounded hippo
                        did the same. I shot whenever I saw him. Arriving at the crossing the
                        men were all for continuing the chase. As sunset was approaching and
                        a motorcycle could not travel those crooked paths in the dark, we were
                        obliged to leave our hippo. It was reported that villagers twelve miles
                        farther down feasted on him a few days later. Reluctantly the porters
                        went with me, mourning for hundreds of pounds of good meat floating
                        down river. </p>

                    <h3>Mixed-up Marriages. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">One subject of discussion
                        among missionaries had always puzzled me. It was the question about
                        a man marrying his deceased brother's wife. Sometimes this amounted
                        to marrying the widow as if she were a slave, without her consent.
                        Because it was commonly practiced in some tribes, the subject kept
                        coming up again and again. But an inheritance that was even worse,
                        and never debatable, was the case of a man marrying his father's widow.
                        Why he would want to do that I could not see. But imagine my thoughts
                        when on itineration I happened upon this case of a candidate for baptism.
                        Up to this point his answers had been satisfactory. Then I asked him, "Are
                        you married?" He said he was. I asked, "Do you have any children?" His
                        reply was peculiar, "She has two children." I was a little irked at
                        the seeming evasion. I asked then, "Have <i>you </i>any children?" He
                        answered, "I have one child." So I inquired, "Whose is the other child?" He
                        said, "It is the child of my grandfather. She was formerly my grandfather's
                        wife." If you can figure out all the several relationships of those
                        two children, you must be adept in such matters. </p>
                    <h3>Holding up the Rain.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">For building purposes
                        I was rather partial to the four or five months of dry season. Rains
                        can greatly hinder the making and drying of bricks, and all masonry
                        construction, especially when mud is employed for mortar, as was then
                        common practice. We were surprised in the middle of a rainy season,
                        when an unseasonable dry spell was threatening future famine, to be
                        told that out in the heathen villages people said that Kabemba (that
                        was I) was holding up the rain, to facilitate his building program.
                        Of course I wouldn't have done that even if I could. I was worried
                        that people should believe such a thing. Next day was Sunday. I was
                        in charge of the afternoon Sunday School. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">There I called on
                        two of the elders to pray for rain. Within 24 hours it poured. Just
                        what the heathen said then I do not know. </p>
                    <h3>Saddest Time of All. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Some time later Mignon
                        was seriously ill. Dr. Kellersberger was on furlough, so Dr. King of
                        Mutoto station, about 120 miles away, was supposed to care for us.
                        He came, and took charge of the case right through, even though there
                        was illness in his own home. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Wife's condition was
                        extremely serious. Our baby Roberta was born, and it seemed as if there
                        was no hope of saving the life of either mother or daughter. As I knelt
                        by Mignon's bedside, thinking she was gone, I felt absolutely
                        desolate. To be left at a little, station in Central Africa, ten thousand
                        miles from home, a bereaved husband with three small daughters, was
                        a darkness that could indeed be felt. Through many long hours while
                        her life lay in the balance, Dr.King devotedly did everything that
                        could be done to save her life. Slowly she began to get back a little
                        strength. Miss Farmer, our nurse, and Mrs. McKee did all they could
                        in the way of nursing. But part of the night nursing necessarily fell
                        to me. The next six weeks were hard weeks. It was rainy season. I had
                        unroofed a brick house to replace the grass roof with a metal one.
                        Not covered, the mud-mortar walls would soon wash away. I had to work
                        very hard during the day, and help nurse wife and baby at night. At
                        the end of six weeks it seemed as if the worst was over. Baby was gaining,
                        and Mignon was able to walk again. But one nightI was so fatigued that
                        I forgot to set the alarm clock for the baby's two o'clock feeding.
                        We have always been so thankful to God that we waked up at two o'clock
                        without the alarm. While Mignon was making little Roberta comfortable,
                        and I was preparing her bottle, Mignon called me to say that the baby
                        was gone. She was alive when we waked, and died while her mother was
                        caring for her. Oh, how we did thank the Lord that we were spared from
                        sleeping through that hour! </p>
                    <h3>Basket for a Coffin.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">For a very special
                        reason we buried baby Roberta in a neat native-made basket. It was
                        a question of con- science. Before foreigners came the natives of
                        most tribes buried their dead in mats woven of reeds. After the people
                        saw missionaries and their children buried in wooden coffins covered
                        with cloth, they wished to imitate the foreign method of burial.
                        But they lacked the boards, and often the cloth too. At Luebo this
                        had become a problem. Our sawmill production was needed for so many
                        other purposes that we could not afford to build up an ever growing
                        business as unpaid undertakers. I had helped to make coffins for
                        two Christian leaders there. But when relatives kept coming with
                        requests for coffins to bury all who died in a village of ten thousand
                        souls it was quite another matter. I suggested that they could continue
                        to bury as they had always done, or if they really wanted wooden
                        coffins individuals could saw lumber as it was done elsewhere, and
                        sell it to the public. I did sympathize with them. I told Mignon
                        that when I died I wished to be buried in mats after the native custom, just to show that there
                        was
                        no special value in wooden coffins. We had not forgotten this when
                        little Roberta died. We decided to bury her in a native-made basket,
                        in a grave lined with native mats. This helped us with good conscience
                        to say no to the frequent requests for boxes for the burial of their
                        dead. </p>

                        at breakfast
                        we were all excited by a message saying that there was a buffalo on
                        the station. So we got our guns and went after it. It was killed. I
                        knew that I had not done the killing, for the shells of the ancient
                        Martini-Henri rifle I used never went off. </p>
                    <h3>Rainbow at Night.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">One evening I happened
                        to be on the front porch of our house, overlooking the beautiful Lubilashi
                        valley far below. Something new appeared, and I could hardly believe
                        my eyes. There in the distance was a rainbow by moonlight. Hurriedly
                        I called Mignon to see it, for I feared folks would think I dreamed. Then
                        I looked up the subject of rainbows in an old encyclopedia, and found
                        them described as phenomena appearing by sunlight or moonlight. </p>

                    <h3>Depraved People. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">We were traveling
                        among a depraved people. Their customs were of the vilest. Examination
                        of candidates for baptism, and of Church members before communion,
                        in some cases brought out facts which were altogether sickening. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">One of the customs
                        I remember was that young boys and girls were paired off in childhood
                        by their parents as "friends." This was not even a pretence of marriage,
                        nor trial marriage. These children lived together in sexual union.
                        When they grew up, the girl was married off to another man, the boy
                        took another woman as his wife. They might go to live far apart in
                        distant villages. But when there was a funeral in the old home town,
                        they returned for the days or weeks of wailing. For the duration of
                        the long funeral these "friends" of childhood lived together again
                        in sexual union. Afterward they returned to their regular marriage
                        partners. Thinking of such things in connection with the breakdown
                        of sex standards in America, one marvels at the patience of Almighty
                        God. Why should He let our nation survive until we all reach the level
                        of the Babindi? </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Work among these people
                        was so difficult that none of our evangelists wished to live among
                        them, nor rear their own children there. Many years later some of those
                        evangelists still looked back with horror to the days when they were
                        assigned to serve there. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">When they wished to
                        describe a section as of the very lowest, they likened it to the Babindi
                        country. </p>
                    <h3>Hill Country.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">That Babindi country
                        is just about as hilly as any country could be, for most of the path
                        was uphill, which was bad, and the rest of it was downhill, which was
                        worse. Our family was supposed to be traveling by hammock. But the
                        paths were so much uphill and downhill that we really traveled on our
                        own shoeleather much of the time. In fact, two feet were sometimes
                        not sufficient for the steep climbing. Occasionally we had to use both
                        hands and both feet for getting over the steepest places. </p>
                    <h3>New Village Every Night.</h3>

                                width="300" height="230" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>If you have
                        ever traveled
                        six hours per day for three weeks, and slept in a new place every night,
                        you may understand this itineration by our family. In 21 days we lived
                        in 18 huts, moving every day except Sundays. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Probably you have
                        never broken up housekeeping eighteen times in three weeks. Early every
                        morning we rose for a new journey. The cook and houseboy prepared breakfast
                        while we had our private devotions. Then while we ate breakfast, cots
                        and mosquito nets and sheets and blankets were quickly packed up. Pots,
                        pans, and dishes were washed. Then the table and chairs and boxes were
                        gotten in readiness. The porters bustled about getting their loads.
                        The boxmen and hammockmen were all gathered at roll call. A hymn was
                        sung and prayer offered. Then through the long wet grass of the early
                        morning, or through forest paths, the long caravan started off for
                        the next village where the Mission had a teacher-evangelist. </p>
                    <h3>Arrival in a Village.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">About noon or later
                        the village might be reached. There was a rush of preparation. Our
                        dinner must be prepared and served. Beds had to be set up, mosquito
                        nets hung, table and chairs made ready, water for cooking and drinking
                        boiled to kill the abundant germs, and everything put in order for
                        the afternoon and night. This of course was not done without observation.
                        A crowd flocked around mentally photographing every object we had and
                        every move we made. Obviously the observers could not be permitted
                        inside the hut where we stayed. But they came as far as the sentry
                        would permit, and sometimes farther. </p>

                        free to
                        meet groups of women, and to get acquainted with the wives of the preachers,
                        work she dearly loved. She also had to keep an eye on our little girls,
                        as there are all kinds of health hazards in ordinary village life,
                        flies, jiggers, and parasites. She was specially interested in getting
                        girls and women to see that school and books were meant for them as
                        well as for the boys and men. In some places parents did not want their
                        girls to attend school, as they were needed to work at home or in the
                        gardens, or babysit while their mothers worked. Mignon also liked to
                        teach them to sing. </p>
                    <h3>Candidates for Baptism. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">The Congolese children
                        memorized readily. All who professed faith in Jesus were expected to
                        learn a Tshiluba language catechism. This was a basis for explanation
                        of the things of Christ. Some of these catechumens were ready for examination,
                        to see whether they were sound in their faith, and faithful in their
                        living. Such as were found ready would be baptized at the preaching
                        service, which was usually held in the afternoon. </p>

                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Following the preaching
                        service individual members of the Church would appear before the elder
                        and missionary and evangelist for questioning before coming to the
                        Lord's table. Were they really living for Christ? Usually some would
                        be found faithful, but some would have backslidden. Sometimes the sin
                        was polygamy, other times stealing, drunkenness, adultery, the worship
                        of spirits, or other sins. While the outward symptoms differ, sin is
                        essentially the same through the ages, being "any want of conformity
                        unto, or transgression of the law of God." Often the sinners were penitent,
                        sometimes they were not. They were dealt with according to their attitudes;
                        sometimes temporarily suspended from communion, or where they were
                        altogether hardened in sin they were excommunicated. Then there was
                        the examination of those previously disciplined, and restoration to
                        Church fellowship of those who seemed to be really penitent. I </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">One of the most hopeful
                        aspects of our work has always been that many of those who have gone
                        astray have come back in true repentance to their Saviour. </p>
                    <h3>Communion Service. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Whenever there were
                        communicants the Lord's Supper was observed, at night. At the Lord's
                        table would be gathered a little company of those saved out of the
                        night of heathenism by the bright shining of Jesus, the Light of the
                        World. What these people had been saved from I had opportunity to observe
                        in the examination of catechumens. Often tears came to my eyes at the
                        communion service as I thought of the dark past and the glorious future
                        of these fellow Christians gathered around the simple table with the
                        elements representing His body broken for us, and the blood of the
                        new covenant, shed for the forgiveness of sins. And in my heart I was
                        glad I was a missionary. </p>
                    <h3>Mukumbule, Village of Fetishes. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">One day our party
                        reached Mukumbule, one of the many places "where every prospect pleases,
                        and only man is vile."<a href="Pictures/20.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/20.jpg"
                                width="300" height="389" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a> The village
                        was built in a magnificent grove
                        of palms. The huts were not much to boast of -Congo huts, having thatched
                        roofs, are usually in a state of decay. While the huts were second-rate,
                        and even poor, the village had an unusually large number of fetishes,
                        in a country where fetishes are common. Through the long, winding village
                        street, one could never get out of sight of one or another of the big
                        ones. Each was made of a conical mound of earth, flattened on the top,
                        with a lot of bushes stuck in the middle, and the whole mound gaily
                        decorated in bright colors. These mounds were neatly made, and were
                        given the places of prominence in the street. Throughout the village
                        there were also large numbers of a different kind of fetish -bottles
                        brightly decorated with colors, with feathers in the corks and who-knows-what
                        on the inside. Most of the houses would have at least one of these
                        bottles near the door. Some huts had as many as four or six. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Having arrived in
                        the village somewhat after noon, I preached as was my custom. But there
                        were no candidates for baptism. In the evening there was a communion
                        service. Few from Mukumbule took part. Most of the communicants came
                        from other villages. The outlook was not bright. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Two villages were
                        to be visited next day, so I retired soon after the communion service.
                        Early next morning the party arose, had breakfast, and packed up for
                        the journey. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Mignon and the little
                        girls had gone ahead in their hammocks. The boxmen had hurried off
                        with their loads. My own men stood ready with the hammock, wishing
                        to get into the path before the sun became too hot. After completing
                        such arrangements as had to be made. I was just about to get into my
                        hammock, when the pastor and elder who traveled with me came, looking
                        troubled. </p>
                    <h3>The Witch Doctor. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">(My friend the anthropologist
                        says that witch doctor is not the correct name. But it will convey
                        the idea better than some other term, so I let it stand. On this trip
                        among the Babindi I had my only important experience with a witch doctor.) </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText"><a href="Pictures/10.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/10.jpg"
                                width="300" height="327" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>"We have a
                        matter
                        to talk over with you before you leave here," said the elder. So I
                        turned back for a conference before leaving Mukumbule. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"We sat up late last
                        night considering the state of the Lord's work in this village," said
                        the pastor, "and we find it to be very serious." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"What seems to be
                        the trouble?" </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"There is a witch
                        doctor here who is hindering the work with every means at his command.
                        If he merely followed his own business that would be bad enough. You
                        can see all the fetishes he sells to these poor people at scandalous
                        prices, thus keeping them wretchedly poor. Besides that he deliberately
                        interferes with those who wish to worship God here. He intimidates
                        them with threats." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Tell me more about
                        him."</p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"He lives in this
                        village. He made all the fetishes you saw, the big ones at every turning
                        of the village street, and all the small ones you saw at the doors
                        of the people's huts, those bottles. For all of these they paid him
                        big sums of money. " </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Is that all he does?"</p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Oh, no! He makes
                        charms to put on people's necks. He claims that he can make it rain
                        when he wants to, and can prevent it from raining. He says he can make
                        sick people well and well people sick. He says he can make charms that
                        will cause people to die." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"But how does he interfere
                        with our work here?"</p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"That is what we wanted
                        to talk about. You know that the Government promises us religious liberty.
                        But this man tells the people that he has investigated the white man's
                        God, and found him to be of no account. They need not worry about that
                        God. However, he says that if they do not obey him, the witch doctor,
                        he will make them suffer for it. He says the people must not send their
                        children to school or Church or catechism class at such times as he
                        forbids it. If they send them at such times and it breaks his charms,
                        he will beat the children, and what he will do to the parents will
                        be enough." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Do the children really
                        mind him?"</p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Truly, they are very
                        much afraid of him, and that is what makes the situation so very bad.
                        Because of that one man's threats the work of the Lord in this village
                        is almost dead."</p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"What do you want
                        me to do about it?" </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"We want you to write
                        a letter to the Bula Matadi (name for a state officer or for the Government)
                        at Panyi Mutombo, asking him to order the witch doctor to stop interfering
                        with the work of the Gospel." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Do you think that
                        would cure the trouble?" </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Oh, yes, the Bula
                        Matadi could stop the whole thing." "But it seems to me there is a
                        difficulty in the way. Suppose I do send a note to Bula Matadi, what
                        will happen then? He will call for witnesses. Then if our evangelist
                        goes to tell what he did, the witch doctor will threaten and frighten
                        a hundred people into going as his witnesses to say the charges are
                        not true. What can Bula Matadi do but decide in favor of so many witnesses?
                        Then you will return, and the people will laugh at the evangelist and
                        the Gospel, and even at God Himself." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"What then can be
                        done?" I sent a man to call the witch doctor, another to call the head
                        man of the village, and a third to bring his Tshiluba Bible. I opened
                        the Bible to Acts 13.6-12. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">The witch doctor came,
                        rubbing his eyes, for he had just gotten out of bed. The head men of
                        the village also arrived. First I turned to the head men. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"You people in this
                        village are very foolish. You have in the village this witch doctor,
                        and poor as you are you pay him large sums of money for making his
                        medicines, and they can do you no good at all. This man has no power.
                        He can do none of those things he claims to have power to do. Yet you
                        fear him and waste your good money by paying him for these worthless
                        fetishes." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Then I took the open
                        Bible, and turning to the witch doctor I explained to him some of the
                        background of Acts 13, then began reading at verse 6, in Tshiluba (herewith
                        I quote the English version) : </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"And when they had
                        gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a
                        false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus: Which was with the
                        deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for
                        Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the Word of God. But Elymas
                        the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them,
                        seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. Then Saul, who is also
                        called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, and
                        said, O full of an subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil,
                        thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the
                        right ways of the Lord? And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon
                        thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And
                        immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about
                        seeking some to lead him by the hand. Then the deputy, when he saw
                        what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Then I continued to
                        speak to our witch doctor: "Now you have heard what happened long ago
                        to Elymas the sorcerer. I am here to tell you that you are just the
                        kind of person Elymas was. You are a child of the devil, an enemy of
                        all righteousness, and you pervert the right ways of the Lord. You
                        have withstood the work of the Lord just as Elymas did when he tried
                        to turn the deputy away from the faith. You have blasphemed the name
                        of God by saying the people need not fear Him." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Chief, I never did
                        those things. I never blasphemed God's name. I never interfered with
                        the worship. I have done none of those things." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Now, see here! You
                        cannot deceive me, and you cannot deceive these people. All the people
                        of the village know what you have done and said. Hush! do not add any
                        more lies. You are a wicked man. And now, to show these people that
                        you have no power, and that you cannot do what you claim, I challenge
                        you to kill me with your charms during the next thirty days. You say
                        you can make charms that will cause people to die. Very well, make
                        all the charms you like for the next thirty days and see whether they
                        will kill me." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"No, no, Chief, I
                        do not want to kill you." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"But you couldn't
                        if you did want to." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">I continued, "On the
                        other hand, you have told the people they need not fear the God of
                        the missionaries. You said He has no power. The God of the missionaries
                        is the Creator of heaven and earth, Nvidi Mukulu. He is the one who
                        created all men. He created you and me. A long time ago He sent this
                        man Paul, of whom I have just read, to preach His Gospel. Now He has
                        sent me to preach the same good news. Elymas the sorcerer withstood
                        Paul. God laid His hand on Elymas and he became blind. Now you have
                        withstood the Gospel here. Right now this little group of Christians
                        can pray to God to lay His hand on you. We can pray to Him right now,
                        and then we shall see how long it takes Him to lay His hand on you
                        and make you blind." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">The witch doctor was
                        scared. "Oh, Chief, don't do it. They have told you lies. I never did
                        those things they." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"Hush! hush! Do not
                        add any more lies. You know and these people know that you have talked
                        against God, and said He has no power. Now let us try Him and see whether
                        He has any power." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"No! No! Chief, do
                        not do that." After the witch doctor had begged sufficiently to show
                        the village chiefs and all the people just how much he feared the God
                        against whom he had spoken so bravely, I turned to them and said, "Now
                        you can see what kind of man this witch doctor really is. I am not
                        afraid of his medicine, but he is afraid of this God whom he has been
                        talking against." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Turning to the witch
                        doctor, I said, "We shall not do this thing at present. We will not
                        pray God to hurt you. We are your friends, not your enemies. We have
                        come to help you, not to hurt you. I hope you will truly turn to Christ,
                        and preach His Gospel instead of withstanding it." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Shaking hands with
                        the witch doctor, I said, "Now goodbye. I shall be praying for you
                        to be converted. But I warn you in any case to stop interfering with
                        the work of the Lord. Wherever I may be, whether off in other villages
                        on this journey, or yonder at Bibanga, or far away on the great waters,
                        or even in the distant foreign country, the word can reach me. If word
                        comes that you have resumed your evil ways of threatening people who
                        wish to worship God, at that time we will have a prayer meeting and
                        ask God to lay His hand on you as He did on Elymas the sorcerer long
                        ago. Then we shall see how long it takes Him to answer prayer. Then
                        we shall see whether He is a God to be feared or not." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Bidding goodbye to
                        the headmen of the village, I got into my hammock, and the strong hammockmen
                        hurried off with me in pursuit of the rest of our party.</p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Later I heard that
                        after our departure the witch doctor stepped up to the chief of the
                        village and said, "You went and told the white man tales about me." </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">"No," said the chief, "I
                        did not tell him anything about you." "I told the white man about you," said
                        the evangelist. "What do you have to say about it? Do you want me to
                        call the white man back?" </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Three months later
                        it was reported that the witch doctor had lost all his influence in
                        the village of Mukumbule, as people no longer feared him. </p>
                    <h3>Lumo Loa Bena Kasai.</h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">By the end of our
                        first term in Congo two ideas were fixed in my mind. One was that there
                        ought to be a cotton mill to produce cloth for the native people at
                        a reasonable price. That first idea was voted down by the Mission after
                        I had investigated the matter, because of the high initial cost. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">The second idea was
                        that we ought to publish a monthly periodical in the Tshiluba language
                        to provide mental and spiritual food for the teachers we had placed
                        in hundreds of villages, as well as for the pupils in our schools.
                        This was no new idea. There had been some sort of periodical before
                        the First World War. It was a casualty of that terrible conflict. I
                        felt so strongly that there should be a regular monthly Church paper
                        that I continued to agitate for it through our second term. The Mission
                        agreed that the objective was desirable, but saw no way to accomplish
                        it. When I secured a mimeograph, Mr. V. A. Anderson and I were made
                        editors. We published a little paper every three months, calling it
                        the LUMU LUA BENA KASAI, that is, News of the People of the Kasai.
                        While we were busy with other assignments, we were planning how we
                        might bring messages of cheer and hope to lonely workers in heathen
                        villages. Every year at Mission Meeting I would urge that the paper
                        be printed every month at the Mission Press at Luebo. By and by the
                        Mission agreed to print it at the Mission Press every <i>three </i>months. </p>
                    <h3>Strange Noises in the Mailbag. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Bibanga station got
                        its foreign mail by foot messenger from the post office at Kabinda,
                        fifty miles to the east. Our little girls received from America a gift
                        of two crying dolls. <a href="Pictures/65.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/65.jpg"
                                width="300" height="353" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>They came by
                        mail. It was a much puzzled messenger
                        who arrived at Bibanga after traveling two days with that mail sack
                        on his head or shoulder. All along the way he heard the funniest noises
                        coming out of the mail bag. </p>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">The life of children
                        on a Mission station often takes on some local color. After Dr. Kellersberger
                        returned from furlough there was constant talk of operations being
                        performed at the hospital. Frank was the surgeon, and the girls were
                        nurses. The patient was one of the crying dolls. The surgeon cut out
                        the part that cried. </p>
                    <h3>Rain Gauge. </h3>
                    <p class="MsoBodyText">Africans and foreigners
                        often failed to understand each other. An Administrator of our Territory
                        once had instructions to erect some rain gauges for scientific purposes.
                        He fastened one to a post near the house of a chief, leaving orders
                        that it must not be touched. When he returned to the village after
                        some time to check the rainfall he found his gauge perfectly safe.
                        The chief had had his workmen build a roof over the gauge to protect
                        it! </p>
