        <h1>FIRST TERM IN CONGO-Continued </h1>
        <h3>Diamonds.</h3>
        <p><a href="Pictures/59.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/59.jpg" width="300" height="462" hspace="8"
                    vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>During our
            stay at Luebo we had a guest on the station,
            the most successful prospector employed by the diamond mining corporation,
            which held the concession for all diamonds and other minerals in the
            whole area. He was on our station for medical care, and occasionally
            had meals at our table. One morning he said he had something to show
            us if we would clear the dining table. When that was done, he produced
            a pickle jar half full of rough diamonds. He poured them on the tablecloth
            and let us examine them. It was really fun to play with hundreds of diamonds,
            observing the differences between the stones. Times have changed in Congo.
            That would not happen now. </p>
        <p>Traveling through the country one sometimes thought
            of the diamonds which might be all around. At first it rather annoyed
            me to think that even if I were to find a diamond I could not keep it.
            But thinking it over I realized that if finders of diamonds could keep
            them, the country would soon be filled with the dregs of mankind, who
            would make the state of the heathen people even worse. So I no longer
            worry about diamonds. </p>
        <h3>1918 Armistice.</h3>
        <p>We were at Luebo when the First World War ended. But
            we didn't hear about the Armistice until a week later. We did not yet
            have telegraph, telephone, or wireless at Luebo. The news reached Lusambo
            by wireless, and was brought to Luebo by foot messenger. It was the most
            welcome kind of news to all of us foreigners so far away from the outside
            world. </p>
        <h3>Job Lukumuenu.</h3>
        <p><a href="Pictures/rc25.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/rc25.jpg" width="300" height="403" hspace="8"
                    vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>One of the
            happy memories of our first stay at Luebo
            was our acquaintance with Job Lukumuenu, the crippled boy. He could not
            walk. But his little hut by the wayside was a magnet attracting many
            people, both American and African. Job was a patient sufferer, and one
            of the most radiant Christians I have ever known. He was a wonderful
            influence for Christ among the young people of Luebo, and an encouragement
            to the missionaries. He died during our first year on the Mission. It
            could be said of him as of Abel of old, that &quot;he, being dead, yet
            speaketh.&quot; </p>
        <h3>Lusambo Trip. </h3>
        <p>A year after I took charge of the Industrial School
            the students were given a vacation of three months, and was sent for
            a short stay at Lusambo. This was a transit point up the Sankuru River,
            for freight coming up River for the Methodist Mission to the north, and
            two Presbyterian stations south. So the station had to be kept open.
            Mr. Stilz, of the Methodist Mission had been sent there. But that was
            outside of his language area. He needed help from someone who spoke the
            Tshiluba language. Therefore I was sent for a stay of two months at Lusambo,
            leaving Mignon and baby Alice at Luebo. I made the long trip overland
            by hammock. The trip took about 11 days, besides a stopover at our station
            at Mutoto. The doctor provided me with potassium permanganate for snakebite,
            with instructions for its use if one of my porters should be bitten.
            I dreaded giving anyone the heroic treatment prescribed, so I was thankful
            that on that long trip of about 800 miles before I saw Luebo again, none
            of my men was bitten. In fact, in all the years I never had to treat
            a case of snake bite. </p>
        <h3>Monkey and Ants.</h3>
        <p>I have never been much of a hunter, but took a shotgun
            with me on this trip. On a bright, sunny morning was being carried through
            a magnificent, beautiful forest, when the man ahead called that there
            was an animal nearby. I dismounted and followed the men away from the
            footpath, where they pointed to a monkey way up in a tree, framed by
            a circle of foliage, like round window. Africans are quite fond of monkey
            meat, and as neither they nor I claimed any relationship to the monkeys,
            I hat no objection to shooting one if I could. Taking good aim, I fired.
            The monkey fell to the ground with a thud. But suddenly I found myself
            with other and more urgent business. While looking up I had stepped into
            an army of the dreaded driver ants. They were attacking in force. I had
            to remove my trousers to pick off those pestiferous invaders. The men
            had monkey meat that afternoon and were happy. </p>
        <h3>More about Hammocks. </h3>
        <p><a href="Pictures/48.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/48.jpg" width="300" height="238" hspace="8"
                    vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>Nowadays it
            is almost impossible to find men strong
            enough, or willing, to carry a hammock. Men who are strong enough for
            that are likely to go off to work in the mines. But in those days strong
            men thought it an honor to be on the hammock line, and there was quite
            an esprit de corps among them. They could travel from 20 to 30 miles
            a day, and in an emergency they might do 40 miles. Twenty-five miles
            was a good day. </p>
        <p>There were four pairs of men for the hammock, two
            men carrying at a time, and professionals were so skillful that they
            could change porters almost imperceptibly as they ran. Men who had carried
            hammock a long time developed a kind of muscular cushions on both shoulders.
            It was good entertainment for the villagers when a white man came riding
            through the town in a hammock, and crowds ran alongside the hammock singing
            songs. Sometimes my men would sing, &quot;Owner of chickens, look out
            for your chickens, Kabemba is coming.&quot; My Congo name is Kabemba,
            a species of swift flying chicken hawk, perhaps a kind of falcon, which
            swoops down to steal a chicken, and is gone before the owner can stop
            him. </p>
        <p>Sometimes village men begged the privilege of helping
            to carry the hammock. Then they would race along joyfully to show off
            to the other villagers. On a few occasions my hammock has been dropped
            by these hammock-happy volunteers, but in each case I escaped injury.
            I knew of one missionary who suffered a spine injury from such a fall. </p>
        <h3>Camera Trouble. </h3>
        <p>I had bought a good camera from Mr. Crane for $25.00.
            That was a lot of money to a missionary in those days. But I did want
            pictures. I had taken some on this trip. When we arrived at Mutoto station
            I arranged to develop a roll of film. When I was all set for development
            I opened the camera to remove the roll, and found both camera and film
            watersoaked. All was ruined. At first I could not understand. Then I
            remembered that we had crossed the Muazangombe the day before. That small
            river was out of its banks, and the men had to wade through water waist
            deep before we reached the little bridge. The camera carrier had it tied
            to his waist, but said not a word about the soaking. It was a painful
            disappointment to lose both pictures and camera. I received three dollars
            in trade for my $25.00 camera at Willoughbys in New York. </p>
        <h3>Baptism at Mutoto. </h3>
        <p>The visit with my fellow-missionaries at Mutoto over
            the weekend was a pleasure. On this occasion I assisted in a baptismal
            service. There were about fifty candidates for baptism. Mr. Crane was
            in charge of the service. But he was overworked and tired. The baptismal
            formula is something like this: &quot;Ndi nkubatiza mu dina dia Nzambi
            tatu, ne dia Yesu Kilistc muan'andi, ne dia Nyuma Muimpe.&quot; Saying
            over the same formula 25 times was wearying to the tongue. It seemed
            to me that Mr. Crane's tongue was on the verge of slipping, and if he
            made a mistake somebody would laugh, and spoil the solemnity of the service.
            So I moved to his side and offered to take over. I baptized the other
            25 converts. </p>
        <h3>On to Lusambo.</h3>
        <p>Next day I resumed my journey to Lusambo. One night
            I slept in the guest house in a village recently troubled by leopards.
            My men were afraid to camp on the verandah, as some of them usually did.
            They left me alone in my house, advising me to close doors and windows
            tight on account of the leopard. I could not sleep without air, so I
            piled up some trunks before the open door, and left the upper half open,
            hoping the leopard would not find me. He didn't. I was happy when I reached
            my destination. Mr. Stilz and I were bachelors together for two months.
            I was lonely for Mignon and our little daughter Alice. The evangelistic
            work of Lusambo station was in my charge while I was there, teaching
            Bible classes, preaching, and generally looking after the work of the
            station. </p>
        <h3>Eclipse. </h3>
        <p>One day in mid-afternoon I was teaching a Bible class
            in the grass-roofed chapel. The roof was rather low at the edges, so
            most of our light was reflected from the ground. It grew darker and darker,
            until we could not see to read. I told the students we had better get
            home before the storm broke. We stepped outside, but to our great surprise
            there was no storm. But it continued to grow darker and darker. There
            was a total eclipse of the sun. Mr. Stilz got a photograph showing a
            perfect corona. Some days later I started on my homeward journey, but
            I was to go out of my way to visit Bibanga station. I arrived there in
            four or five days. A few days out from Lusambo a village chief asked
            me in all seriousness whether it was true, as he had heard, that a white
            man reached up his hand, and covered the sun. </p>
        <h3>Bad Guess. </h3>
        <p><a href="Pictures/30.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/30.jpg" width="300" height="225" hspace="8"
                    vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>The men had
            the laugh on me the day we were to arrive
            at Bibanga. About ten o'clock in the morning they pointed out Bibanga
            on a high hill in the distance, across the Lubilashi River.
            It did not look far, so I said we would hurry in so I could have lunch
            with my friends at Bibanga. They laughed at me. There was the river to
            cross and long hills to climb. I did not know at that time that Bibanga
            is nearly 1000 feet higher than the river. So I told the men I could
            walk in. I walked and walked. We crossed the river in a canoe. The sun
            was hot, and I started climbing hills. I kept walking until I was too
            tired for words. Noon passed, and I was hungry, but I kept on walking.
            Somewhere near two o'clock the men came running with the hammock and
            said we were nearing the station. They must carry me in with hammock
            songs. If I walked in they would have plenty of shame. I figured that
            shame was exactly what they deserved. <a href="Pictures/12.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/12.jpg"
                    width="300" height="456" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>But I was too tired
            to argue, so
            I dropped into the hammock, and they carried me up the last little slope
            to the station. I spent a few happy days with the McKees and the Kellersbergers
            and then resumed my long journey, headed now for Luebo via Luluabourg,
            a distance of 325 miles.</p>
        <h3>Homeward Bound. </h3>
        <p>On the way I visited
            Dr. Motte Martin, of Luebo station, who was out on a long itineration.
            He fed me well. Incidentally, he had a first-class cook (our cooks
            are always men), who cooked for him for about 40 years.</p>
        <h3>Big Chief. </h3>
        <p>In the course of this
            journey I called on Kabengele Dibue, chief of the Bakwa Kalonji tribe.
            Some of our best teachers and preachers had come from his tribe, and
            I wanted to get acquainted. He was a big, strong man, living in the
            kind of large compound common to African chiefs, in which there were
            many huts where his wives lived with their children. There is a division
            of opinion as to how many wives he actually did have. Someone said
            he had 300 wives. Someone else said he paid tax on 300, but that he
            was cheating the government, that he really had 700. I do not know.
            But I do remember asking one of his sons how many sons the chief had.
            He said he had 200 sons, but that the chief himself did not know how
            many daughters he had. On the way I would stop when I could in villages
            where we had evangelist-teachers. I liked to get acquainted with them
            and the Christians in the villages. By and by I reached Luebo and Mignon
            and baby Alice, who was now five months old. Those three months were
            the longest I ever spent.</p>
        <h3>Again Luebo.</h3>
        <p><a href="Pictures/mc3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/mc3.jpg" width="300" height="218" hspace="8"
                    vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>It seemed
            good to
            be on a larger station again. Missionaries argue as to the relative
            merits of large or small stations. We have lived happily on both kinds.
            But certainly the large station gives one the benefit of fellowship
            and counsel with his colleagues which he misses on the small station.</p>
        <p>Our first term was
            the beginning of friendships which have endured through the many years
            of our missionary life, and into the evening of our retirement. Being
            so far away from blood relatives, our missionary group became one great
            family, bound together by ties of love for Christ and His service.
            Children recognized this close relationship in the great family of
            the Mission by calling other missionaries &quot;Uncle&quot; and &quot;Aunt.&quot; So
            through the years we have been known as &quot;Uncle Hershey and Aunt
            Minnie&quot; by many children of the Mission, and our own children
            have many &quot;Uncles&quot; and &quot;Aunts&quot; in this happy relationship,
            which continues through life.</p>
        <h3>Wrong Word. </h3>
        <p>We held some night
            services at various points away from the station in the big Luebo village.
            On one of these occasions I was preaching in the dark. On the way home
            somebody told me I had used the wrong word in my sermon. My text was, &quot;Lay
            not up for yourselves treasures on earth, but lay up for yourselves
            treasures in heaven.&quot; The correct word for treasure chest was &quot;tshibutshilu.&quot; But
            instead of that I used &quot;tshishihelu&quot; which means altar. Preaching
            in the dark, my memory slipped.</p>
        <h3>Lusambo Again. </h3>
        <p>In December 1919 Mr.
            Stegall returned to take over the Industrial School. The Mission assigned
            us to Lusambo for the remaining year of our first term, substituting
            for the Bedingers, who were on furlough. It was decided that the steamer
            Lapsley would take us around to Lusambo, which meant sailing down the
            Lulua and Kasai Rivers to the junction, then up the Sankuru River to
            Lusambo. Our station was on the riverbank two miles east of Lusambo.</p>
        <h3>First Motorcycles. </h3>
        <p>Messrs. Stegall and
            McElroy had brought two heavy motorcycles back with them from furlough.
            We saw these come up the hill at Luebo. They were a great marvel to
            the people, who had seen no vehicle more wonderful than a bicycle.
            So they followed in shouting, laughing crowds, whenever the motorcycles
            were started. The McElroys, their children, and one motorcycle accompanied
            us to Lusambo on the Lapsley. Then they made
            the long journey to Bibanga as best they could. Paths were very poor,
            and hills very high and steep. It was a great undertaking to get a
            motorcycle over those rugged paths.</p>
        <h3>Mutual Aid.</h3>
        <p>Except for occasional
            visitors, we lived alone on Lusambo station that year, which was eventful
            and crowded with activity. The Commissaire of the District was friendly.
            He knew some English, having been a liaison officer with the British
            army in Egypt during the war. It was agreed that he would write me
            letters in English, and I would write to him in French, and we would
            correct each other's letters. This would have been very helpful to
            my small knowledge of French. But we did not get far before he was
            sent into the interior with an expedition to subdue a cannibal tribe
            who had the playful habit of shooting with poisoned arrows at white
            men on passing steamers. I think they had killed one state officer.</p>
        <h3>Then We Were Four.</h3>
        <p>In March our daughter
            Dorothy Anne appeared in our home. The Italian doctor from Lusambo
            was in town and came to help us, and Miss Hutchinson, a British missionary
            nurse and trained midwife, also came to stay with us. The Edmistons
            of our own Mission, going on furlough, stayed with us while waiting
            for a steamer. Mrs. Edmiston took charge of the housekeeping, and everything
            connected with the important event went off perfectly. At three o'clock
            one afternoon some guests to tea left us by canoe. Before five-thirty
            our baby daughter was safe in bed. We were so thankful to our loving
            Heavenly Father for His tender care. That baby girl has become a missionary
            mother in a much disturbed Korea. We might worry for her safety, and
            for her family. But as we recall how graciously the Lord cared for
            her then, we are sure He will protect her still.</p>
        <h3>Scottish Friend.</h3>
        <p><a href="Pictures/af21.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/af21.jpg" width="300" height="213" hspace="8"
                    vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>One day at
            Lusambo
            we had three callers. The district manager of the SEDEC, a large merchandising
            corporation, called to introduce two new agents. One of these was Mr.
            John Morrison, of Glasgow, with whom we became great friends. He later
            joined our Mission. For 35 years he did great service on our Mission,
            first as a businessman, later as a minister and educator. He used to
            come on Sunday afternoons to tea, and we had worship together, and
            sang hymns. These visits were very refreshing.</p>
        <h3>Coffin Story.</h3>
        <p>Once while Mignon
            was ill with fever we heard of the death of an American lady who was
            visiting on the BritishMission 18 miles down river. Mr. Morrison took
            Europeans from Lusambo to the funeral on the SEDEC steamer. I could
            not go. When they returned they reported that Mr. Nixon, an old English
            missionary, was so ill with blackwater fever that in violent chills
            he shook his whole bed. It seemed certain that he would die. Because
            I was the only male missionary within a hundred miles, it gave me great
            concern. Was it not my responsibility to see that he was decently buried?
            Travel by canoe or on foot was so slow that if I waited for notice
            of his death I could not get a coffin made and have the burial within
            24 hours, as our climatic conditions required. So in my third-rate
            French I wrote to the manager of the LaCourt Plantation asking whether,
            in the event of Mr. Nixon's death, they could provide a coffin. They
            may not have understood exactly what I wanted to say. They at once
            began to make the coffin. To the surprise of everybody, Mr. Nixon got
            well. The plantation presented him with his coffin. He kept it for
            years, but never used it, as he died years later in England.</p>
        <h3>Interpreter Wanted.</h3>
        <p>At Lusambo I was busy
            enough before the storm which destroyed the Church. I had been preaching
            and teaching, and had supervision of the outstation work, besides a
            dispensary with a medical assistant in charge. Then there was transport
            for the Methodist Mission, as well as Bibanga and Mutoto stations of
            our own Mission. Caravans of 20 to 100 men would come in to be loaded
            with boxes of merchandise which I had previously moved from the steamer
            landing at Lusambo. Then came the storm which blew down the chapel.
            As Mr. Bedinger, who would soon be back to take over his work, was
            not a builder, I felt I must build a new chapel before we left for
            furlough. So I was very, very busy. One day I took a lot of porters
            to Lusambo to get some freight for the Methodist Mission that had arrived
            by steamer. But the Administrator of the Territory, in those days of
            scarce personnel, was loaded with more work than he could possibly
            do. When I found him sweating under his impossible load, I sent our
            porters home empty rather than to trouble him while he was checking
            cargo from the steamer. But as stated before I was too busy. I did
            not send for the boxes for two weeks. I received notice that I owed
            demurrage on the cargo because it stayed in the warehouse too long.
            I was worried, for I had no source of money to pay such a bill. And
            I was vexed at the injustice of it, when I paid my men to return empty
            just to help out the overworked Administrator. Feeling as I did, I
            feared that my poor French might involve me in unpleasantness. I went
            to see our friend, Mr. Morrison, to ask him to interpret for me, and
            explain the situation to the Administrator. To my great disappointment
            Mr. Morrison was out of town. There was no choice. The matter must
            be handled at once, so I went to the Transport office and did the best
            I could. The affair was amicably arranged, and I was excused from making
            payment. But imagine my surprise, before I left town, to be called
            back to this same Administrator's office. He asked whether I could
            interpret for him and an American prospector.</p>
        <p>It happened that the
            American was sent by a mining syndicate to explore some territory on
            which their option was nearing expiration. That section was dangerous
            because the natives were in revolt, and the government was unwilling
            to assume any responsibility for the safety of strangers wandering
            in those parts. This had to be<i> </i>interpreted to the American.
            He decided to go at his own risk.Never
            having heard anything more about him, I presume that he survived the
            hazardous journey. But I am always amused when I think of my having
            sought an interpreter, then having been asked to serve in the same
            capacity.</p>
        <h3>Clothing Shortage. </h3>
        <p>While I was building
            the chapel, two Methodist missionaries, Messrs. Lynn and Davis, arrived
            on the way from America to their Mission. They stayed with us a night
            or two, then went on to Wembo Nyama. They had to leave their trunks,
            and we had loads for a hundred porters besides. They took pains to
            explain that when a caravan of carriers came, the first things to send
            were the trunks from their bedroom. I understood perfectly, but being
            too busy I forgot. I loaded the caravan with other things. Some days
            later more men came with the urgent plea, &quot;Please send us our
            trunks or we may have to dress in barrels.&quot;</p>
        <h3>Exchange Problems. </h3>
        <p>To folks who stay
            in their homeland the fluctuations of international exchange may not
            seem important, but they were one of my real worries all our years
            in Congo. Ever since the close of the First World War the value of
            the Belgian franc, as well as many other currencies, has been changing
            from time to time. During our first few years in Africa, the value
            of a franc was 19.3 cents, as it used to be given in the dictionaries.</p>
        <p>Roughly we figured
            that a franc was about 20 cents of American money. In those days a
            workman was paid theoretically 9 francs per month, food allowance included,
            but practically it was 8 yards of excellent quality white cotton cloth,
            woven to order, and known as &quot;tshilulu tshia Mission,&quot; that<a href="Pictures/19.jpg"
                target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/19.jpg" width="300" height="228" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0"
                    align="right"></a>
            is, cloth of the Mission. This was far superior to the shoddy stuff
            sometimes sold by traders. The people were not working for money. They
            were working for cloth or salt or soap, or lye for making their own
            soap. Suddenly the franc began to drop. In a short time its value dropped
            from 20 cents to 2 1/2 cents, and prices of cloth began to rise sharply.
            When the fluctuation began we did not understand it, and we supposed
            nobody else in Congo did either. Far from our other missionaries Mignon
            and I were alone with the problem. I explained to our people that I
            supposed the rise in price of cloth was only temporary. But when a
            man who had been bringing his family eight yards of good cloth per
            month came home on pay day with only four yards of the same, there
            was bitterness and complaining in many places. The pastor and elders
            of the Church kept coming to me for relief for themselves, and for
            the evangelists and teachers they represented. I lay awake nights,
            worrying about it. The fact that we had a tablecloth and napkins, and
            curtains at our windows when the Lord's poor people could not clothe
            their children, made me miserable. <a href="Pictures/52.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/52.jpg"
                    width="300" height="131" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>I tried to make the
            best explanations
            possible. The words were not cloth. They were not good enough. By and
            by I was desperate. So when the leaders came one more time, I broke
            down and wept. I told them it was not in my power to help them but
            I did feel for them in their trouble. And to show my sympathy explained
            that practically all my earthly possessions were right in that house.
            They could come and take everything we had. That was the limit of what
            I could do. They were deeply touched by my suffering, and said they
            would not bother me any more about it. They did not want my things,
            and took nothing from me. And they kept their word. I suffered still.
            For I knew that the trouble in their homes was still there. I looked
            with unhappiness on every bit of cloth we had around the house.</p>
        <p>And all through the
            years, whenever the exchange rate has been altered in the money markets
            of the world, it has given me pain. Whoever gained through those transactions
            was doing so at the expense of our poor Africans.</p>
        <h3><a href="Pictures/58.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/58.jpg" width="175" height="288" hspace="8"
                    vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>Healed in Answer to Prayer.</h3>
        <p>One of our experiences
            while alone at Lusambo lingers in memory as an illustration of the
            simple faith of African Christians and God's response to their prayers.
            Little Alice was quite ill. We did the best we could in the way of
            treatment, but did wish that our Mission doctors had been within reach
            to give us advice. But Alice grew worse, and Mignon and I knew that
            her condition was critical. So as I was leaving for the sunrise prayer
            meeting Mignon suggested that I call on the group at the meeting to
            pray for Alice. I presented the request, and the people prayed for
            her recovery. When I returned to the house Mignon told me there was
            a sudden change in Alice's condition. At first she thought the child
            might be dying. Soon it became clear that it was a change for the better,
            and at once she was on her way to recovery. Later Alice was a missionary
            nurse in Congo, then the wife of a minister in Missouri. We are sure
            she is living and serving in answer to the prayers of our African friends.</p>
        <h3>Dorothy's Baptism. </h3>
        <p>At Lusambo we had
            as a co-worker the pastor Musonguela. He was a fine Christian. So it
            was a joy to us to have him baptize our baby daughter Dorothy Anne,
            called Konkolonka by the native people. This was one more tie binding
            us to the people to whom we ministered in the name of Christ.</p>
        <h3>Crocodile Victim. </h3>
        <p>Our station near Lusambo
            was just a good stone's throw from the river, near the junction of
            the Sankuru and Lubi Rivers. One day a man was carried up on the station,
            the worst wounded person I ever saw. He had about twenty wounds on
            his body, some of them just large holes, others gashes as much as six
            inches long. His throat had been torn open, so when he breathed the
            air gurgled out of his windpipe. He looked like a hopeless case. I
            asked our dispensary boy what we could do. He said to call the pastor
            Musonguela, who had been a hospital assistant before he entered the
            ministry. The pastor looked the man over, then advised me not to touch
            him. His reason was that we did not have what was necessary for the
            proper stitching of the wounds. It was highly probable the man would
            die anyhow, and if he did, I would be blamed for his death. Musonguela
            advised me to send him to the government doctor at Lusambo Hospital.
            I did so, and was surprised and pleased to learn that the patient recovered.
            He had enough wounds to kill five white men.</p>
        <p>We were told he had
            been swimming in the Lubi River, wherethe crocodile had caught him. His friends had intervened
            a clubbed the crocodile until it let the man go.</p>
        <h3>Used to Save a Life.</h3>
        <p>Because Mignon twice
            had bacillary dysentery, Dr. Stixrud gave me a vial of Pasteur treatment
            for that deadly disease if she should again be infected. Though I had
            never given an injection he instructed me so I could give it if necessary. By
            and by the wife of one of the deacons became exceedingly ill with the
            same disease. It was clear that her days were few if she were not treated.
            I was concerned for Mignon's safety. But we talked it over and she
            decided that it would be best to trust the Lord for our own future,
            and use this medicine to save this Christian woman's life. I followed
            the instructions and gave the injection to this wife and mother who
            were in desperate need. It was promptly effective and without doubt
            saved a life. We were so thankful we made that decision, for Mignon
            was spared from any more dysentery of that type.</p>
        <h3>Furlough Time.</h3>
        <p>I got the chapel
            built, then it was time to go on furlough. We were looking for the
            return of the Bedingers. But we had no news. Finally it seemed we might
            have to leave before they arrived. That would have presented great
            difficulties, but we prepared for that eventuality. But they happened
            to come up river on the same steamer which was to take us down.</p>
        <p>Those were busy days
            for all, specially for the ladies. We had some Methodist missionaries
            as guests, waiting for the same steamer with us. Mignon had to be hostess
            to everybody the first two days, then pack up our things the latter
            two days. Mrs. Bedinger was unpacking the first two days, then she
            was hostess the latter two days. I had to turn over all the station
            affairs to Mr. Bedinger. Then we started for our first furlough.</p>
        <h3>Danger to the Children.</h3>
        <p><a href="Pictures/hm1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/hm1.jpg" width="300" height="331" hspace="8"
                    vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>During our
            year at
            Lusambo two of our missionary families had lost children by tropical
            diseases as they passed through lower Congo. So there naturally was
            a question whether our dear little girls would get out of Congo with
            their lives. Mignon was sure that if we ever got them safely out of
            Congo she would never bring them back to such a dangerous country. She
            would leave them with relatives in America. Indeed, it was then the
            common practice for missionaries from Europe and America to leave their
            children in the homeland when they returned after furlough. But before
            we were past Belgium on the wayhome their mother was already writing down reasons
            why we should bring the girls back with us to Congo. And they did return,
            and they are still alive, thank God! !</p>
        <h3>River Voyage. </h3>
        <p>The trip down river
            was not particularly enjoyable. We did have the agreeable company of
            friends from the Methodist Mission. But the redheaded river captain
            was not a man after our own hearts. He was very rough with his crew,
            and did not seem at all friendly to us. We had as a fellow passenger
            the wife of a businessman, who stayed on his job while she went to
            Belgium. Once I had reason to see the captain on the bridge, and found
            him sitting there with this young woman in his lap. Nothing was said
            about this unusual form of caring for passengers. She told us later
            that the captain was just like a father to her. <a href="Pictures/28.jpg" target="_blank"><img
                    src="IMAGES/28.jpg" width="300" height="228" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>We
            were thoroughly
            disgusted.</p>
        <h3>Fight on the Riverbank.</h3>
        <p>The captain's roughness
            brought us trouble the last night of the voyage. The steamer was tied
            up for the night at a large plantation bordering the Congo River. This
            was also a refueling post, and there were long stacks of firewood for
            sale. Some of it was brought on board, while the 70 unarmed soldiers
            who were lower-deck passengers, and other native passengers, installed
            themselves around campfires on shore. As the next day would be a busy
            one, I retired soon after dinner. Mignon waked me to say there was
            trouble on shore. I took a look, and saw a great fight going on; possibly
            150 men, or even more, were bombarding each other with chunks of firewood,
            and with burning brands from the campfires. The flying firebrands against
            the dark sky made it look like a Fourth of July celebration. Then someone
            threw a firebrand on the thatched roof of a large warehouse, and suddenly
            the whole scene was brightly illuminated as the roof blazed furiously.
            It was evident that if one man were killed it would mean the death
            of many before morning, and the whole area could become involved. So
            I rushed out as I was, barefoot, dressed in white pajamas, to try to
            stop the fight before blood was shed. Along the deck and down the stairs
            I ran, across the gangplank and into the midst of the fighters. The
            people knew I was a missionary, and that missionaries were their friends.
            None of them would willingly hurt me. I did not know the languages
            of these tribes. I motioned the fighters away from each other as I
            ran back and forth, trying to get the fighters out of the melee. Finally
            I gotthe sides separated, and
            motioned for all the people from the ship to go back on board. Then
            I shooed the local people back to the village. All the while the captain
            had been blowing his shrill call whistle. Nobody paid any attention
            to him. He had completely lost control of the situation. At long last
            things got quiet. Knowing how furiously angry the people were, I placed
            a sentry at each end of the gangplank, and decided to sit on the upper
            deck overlooking the gangplank all night long to make sure the fighting
            had not resumed. By that time I felt sure that our own safety, and
            that of the ship, would be threatened if the fighting broke out again,
            and the population of surrounding villages also becomeinvolved.</p>
        <p>Before settling for
            the night on a steamer chair, I went in to bathe my muddy bare feet.
            By this time I was aware that I probably had two fractured ribs. It
            felt like that when I drew breath for about two weeks. When I washed
            my feet I found blisters from the burning coals of the campfires. In
            the excitement I had not felt them as long as the burns were covered
            with mud.</p>
        <p>At dawn I felt that
            my task was done, and went to get some rest. The captain and a few
            passengers with the plantation owners drew up legal documents about
            the damage caused by the warehouse fire. We never knew who paid the
            reported loss of $2000.00.</p>
        <p>When the cables were
            being loosed for our departure, a woman ran out from behind a hut and
            struck one of the steamer's workmen with a club, leaving a gash on
            his neck that required about a half dozen stitches.</p>
        <p>The best we could
            learn about the origin of the fight was that a quarrel started between
            our captain and the foreman of the fire wood cutters from on shore.
            The captain became angry and threw the foreman downstairs. The latter
            returned and threw a brick at the captain, injuring his foot. Then
            members of the crew put him off the boat, and the fight started.</p>
        <p>Strangely enough the
            captain never said a word to me about the fight. I did not wish to
            embarrass him by speaking of it. But when we reached our destination
            at Kinshasa, we could find no hotel accommodations. He kindly allowed
            our party of missionaries to stay on board ship for the night, taking
            us on to Leopoldville, the next stop. Next morning when I could not
            get porters to transfer our baggage to the railroad station he went
            further and allowed the ship's crew to help move it. This, I took it,
            was his mute way of expressing gratitude to me for pacifying the angry
            mob.</p>
        <h3>Railroad Trip.</h3>
        <p>At that time the railway
            trip to Matadi still took two days. The night between was spent at
            ThysvilIe. When we were safely aboard the train I thought our troubles
            were over. But in the afternoon our train was stopped because of a
            freight wreck ahead. We learned we must spend the night on the train
            out there in the jungle. Our second-class coach was crowded and dirty
            with smoke and soot. We knew the crying of our children would keep
            the other passengers awake. I went to the conductor, a West African
            coastman, asking to pay the difference in fare and transfer to first
            class. He said it could not be done. The day in the hot, smoky, dirty
            train had left me looking very disreputable. So I was both embarrassed
            and surprised to be called by a gentleman in a private car. He was
            the Director of the Banque du Congo Belge, the foremost banker in the
            Congo. Accompanied by a physician, he was taking his wife to Matadi
            to board the ship for Belgium. They had overheard me talking to the
            conductor. Recognizing our unfortunate plight, they generously offered
            that my wife and babies might occupy places in their private car for
            the night. Never was help in need more appreciated than that generous
            offer. We had with us screened beds for the children, and I set them
            up in one end of the banker's car, so Mignon and the little girls got
            some rest. Other passengers in our car, and I, also got more rest than
            would otherwise have been possible. Instead of reaching Thysville Friday
            evening we arrived on Saturday morning at ten o'clock. By that time
            Mignon had a fever. The Methodist missionaries helped nurse her and
            the children over the weekend. Monday morning the train resumed its
            journey to Matadi.</p>
        <h3>Congo Boy Hero.</h3>
        <p>In those days it was
            necessary to carry with us much money for the long journey. I had the
            money and important papers in a briefcase. To make sure I would not
            forget it, I set it between my foot and the leg of the table at breakfast.
            It was a hurried meal, for we had to eat, then rush downhill to the
            train to make sure of seats. But the events of the past days had wearied
            me. We ate. With handbags, one convalescent wife and two small children
            I was off for the train. Halfway down the hill a Negro boy caught up
            with me, held out the briefcase, and asked, &quot;Is it yours?&quot; Without
            prompt and honest action by that boy we would have hadmuch trouble and expense, besides the loss
            of all
            that money. We would have missed our steamer at Matadi, thus having
            a delay of three weeks there with great danger to the children's health,
            and many other inconveniences. The boy was a hero. He will never know
            how much good he accomplished by a prompt use of his head and feet.
            What reward I gave him I cannot recall, but I hope it was enough.</p>
        <p>We reached Matadi
            and again found no hotel room. We were given space for the night upstairs
            in a gloomy, dirty warehouse. But there was reason to be grateful even
            for that. It was far better than spending the night on the street.
            Matadi is one of the earth's hotspots. Its name means rocks. It is
            really a great deep bowl of rocks right under the tropical sun, and
            rarely has a breeze down near the docks. It gets hot all day and stays
            hot all night. We spent a very uncomfortable night. In the morning
            we were happy to get aboard ship and sail for Belgium. It was the end
            of our first term in Congo. Five more were to follow.</p>
