            <p>FOURTH TERM IN CONGO-1931-1936</b> </p>
            <p><a href="Pictures/fm6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/fm6.jpg" align="right"></a>Returning to
                Congo
                this time I knew where I was to go and what I was to do. I was very
                happy to return to my work. Things at the Press were in fine shape.
                Mr. McMurray had done excellent work in editing the Lumu Lua Bena Kasai,
                and in the general printing for the Mission. The printers were there,
                ready for work. We faced a great opportunity. </p>
            <h3>Depression Years.</h3>
            <p>These were the years
                of the world-wide financial depression. They were very difficult years
                in the work of the Mission as a whole. Appropriations from America
                were reduced time after time, while the economic situation of the Congo
                became extremely bad. During the rushing twenties traders had opened
                up many small trading posts throughout the country. Though some of
                the traders were not a good moral influence, they were a financial
                help to our people who could sell them native produce and buy from
                them cloth and other needed articles. As world markets declined, most
                of these small traders had to fold up and leave the country. Numbers
                of these small places stood empty, with grass growing high where there
                had been busy trade before. </p>
            <p>People who had gone
                away to work in the mines and other places came back to the country
                to live. The labor shortage eased up. Men who previously would have
                spurned our small Mission salaries would now have been glad to work
                for us. </p>
            <p><a href="Pictures/67.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/67.jpg" align="right"></a>But our
                appropriations
                for the support of hospitals, schools and evangelistic work were just
                a fraction of what they had been before. The annual Mission Meeting
                decided how the appropriations were to be distributed to the stations.
                Then the station meeting, held at least once a month, had to decide
                how to divide its share of funds. As missionaries were so busy during
                the day these business meetings were often held at night. For years
                money was so scarce that the division of funds between departments
                was most painful. Shall teachers salaries be cut again, or the preachers,
                or the workers at the hospital? Ought we to close down part of the
                great school, or cut down on the orders for medicines so urgently needed?
                Such practical problems had to be faced. Many times I returned home
                after station meeting and lay awake half the night worrying over the
                financial problems of the Lord's work. Our own salaries as missionaries
                were separate from the working budget. They were supposed to provide
                a living something like that of school teachers in America, just a
                modest living. But these salaries were reduced time and again. Yet
                out of their reduced incomes, inadequate for their own needs, many
                missionaries took money time after time to keep going the work they
                loved. </p>
            <p>There was also the
                problem of missionary personnel. Our Board was unable to send out the
                new missionaries who wished to come, and were so very much needed.
                After some years of this, when some new missionaries began to arrive,
                someone compared the mission to a college without a sophomore class. </p>
            <p>To save money on travel
                expense each missionary was asked to defer his furlough for one year,
                thus giving us a five-year term instead of four, though our doctors
                were agreed that four years in the tropics was enough. </p>
            <p>Throughout this term
                we worried with financial problems. I wrestled with the question of
                proper salaries for evangelists. These men were unordained preachers
                and teachers, maintaining our schools in hundreds of villages. The
                Mission wished for the native Church to contribute enough money to
                support all their preachers. <a href="Pictures/AF9.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/AF9.jpg"
                        align="right"></a>Money was scarce,
                and while substantial
                sums were contributed by the Christians, yet the total was never sufficient.
                Various schemes were proposed to the Mission, and some of these were
                adopted. Sadly for our work the shifting sand of international exchange
                with jumping of prices came in to break up the best of plans. </p>
            <p>It will be seen that the financial jugglings of New
                York and London and Brussels affected poor people right into the heart
                of Africa. Financial worries spoiled some of the fun of what was otherwise
                a happy term for us. Even though salaries were cut repeatedly, the missionaries
                in general worried much less about their own needs than about the needs
                of the work.</p>
            <h3>Photo-Engraving Laboratory.</h3>
            <p>During our third term
                I had gotten a start in photo-engraving with the crudest sort of equipment.
                With limited time and too little knowledge, meeting all kinds of obstacles
                including what someone has called "the total depravity of inanimate
                objects," I had produced some usable pictures for printing. I felt
                that I needed a better camera than the one I had made out of corrugated
                roofing. During the furlough I was looking for a photo-engraving camera
                that would really fill our needs. In Chicago I found what was called
                a darkroom camera. Instead of an overgrown camera with a large leather
                bellows, which invited destruction by tropical insects, a whole room
                was made into a camera, and the operator worked inside it. There had
                to be a small vestibule with double doors for a light trap, and tracks
                for moving the plate holder and focusing screen. The lens was mounted
                in a lens board fitted into the wall. The photograph or other copy
                to be reproduced was mounted on a copy board outside the camera. Movable
                arc lights completed the camera equipment. </p>
            <p>This idea commended
                itself to me. At a minimum of cost I could build this darkroom camera,
                and for our purpose it was much better than a bellows camera. Insects
                could not injure it. So I had brought the necessary materials with
                me, and as soon as time permitted we added two little rooms to the
                engraving shop. One room was the darkroom camera, the other the space
                for copy board and arc lamps. </p>
            <p>Dr. Stixrud let me
                put an extension line from the hospital generator to provide the current
                I needed for the arc lamps. Our darkroom camera had another feature
                that made it unique, not another like it in the world. As sunlight
                on clear days would cost nothing, and electric current would not always
                be available, I made the camera reversible. Lens windows were put in
                front and back walls. When the lens faced outdoors I could use sunlight.
                When it faced indoors we could use the arc lamps. This camera would
                have seemed crude to professionals, but to us it seemed wonderful,
                for it enabled me to do at least some of the work I wanted to do. What
                I failed to accomplish was due to time limitations, not due to the
                camera. </p>
            <h3>Fast for Africa.</h3>
            <p>Knowing that in America
                photography and engraving were so co-ordinated that a news event could
                be photographed and appear in the papers the same day, I wondered how
                long it would take us to produce a printing press picture. When the
                Congo Protestant Council met on our station I took a picture of the
                Council group in the morning, developed the negative, dried it as quickly
                as possible, made an enlargement and from that a half tone negative.
                Drying that quickly, I made the print on an enameled copper plate,
                and etched out the halftone picture. I had this printed on the printing
                press and showed it to the councillors before night. This accomplishment
                was lots of fun. Central Africa was going places and doing things. </p>
            <h3>African Photo-Engraver.</h3>
            <p><a href="Pictures/ap2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/ap1.jpg" align="right"></a>There were
                so many
                things to do and so little time. It became clear that I simply must
                train a boy to do part of the engraving work. Because the negative
                making involved the use of potassium cyanide, a deadly poison, I had
                somewhat feared to try this. But with plenty of warning about the danger
                I finally took a man into the laboratory. The most dangerous work I
                did with my own hands. But some of the time-consuming work I began
                to share wherever possible. </p>
            <p>The man learned to
                do line etching, but his eyesight failed, so he was replaced by a younger
                man of twenty. This man Kabongo became a line etcher. </p>
            <p>As the details of
                the zinc etching process are very complicated I have decided to omit
                them, as they would weary most readers. Suffice it to say that Kabonga's
                labors saved me much time, and helped us to use more illustrations
                in the monthly paper and in school books, and even, later, in Pilgrim's
                Progress. </p>
            <p>When the etching on
                the zinc plate was completed, with the drawing covering the ridges
                an over it, it was turned over to our mechanic, Ndibu, to be trimmed
                and nailed to a wooden block just the right height for use in the printing
                press. Shepati and his pressmen could then take over and print a hundred
                or ten thousand copies in a very short time. </p>
            <p>Mr. Walter Johnson,
                of the Chattanooga News, was an officer of the Southern Newspaper Publishers
                Association. Through a mutual friend he asked for information about
                our little engraving experiment. I wrote him in full detail about our
                crude little shop, with two results that came as a total surprise.
                First, a three-page article entitled, "Photo-Engraving in the Interior
                of Africa," appeared on pages <a href="/Pictures/ap2.jpg">402-404 of THE AMERICAN
                    PHOTO-ENGRAVER</a>
                for May, 1932. That was the official journal of the International Photo-Engravers Union
                of North America. With a short introduction, the whole of my letter
                to Mr. Johnson was given in the article. </p>
            <p>The second result
                grew out of the first. <a href="Pictures/rc3.gif" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/RC3.gif"
                        align="right"></a>Some
                cartoonist for a syndicate, familiar with
                photo-engraving, made a fantastic cartoon of a bearded African at the
                etching sink examining a large zinc etching. The caption gave a brief
                but correct description of our work at Luebo. People in a number of
                states clipped the cartoon from their newspapers and sent them to me
                at Luebo. We enjoyed this recognition of our labors in Congo. </p>
            <h3>Encouraging Report.</h3>
            <p>During this term a
                visitor from America reported an incident in her voyage up river. She
                said that their steamer stopped for the night at a small settlement.
                They went for a walk ashore, and as they met native people they saw
                a man and his wife who seemed different from the rest. She saw that
                they had a book, and she was interested. Some person who knew both
                French and English interpreted for her. She learned that the man was
                a brick mason, that he worked at Kinshasa. His employers had sent him
                up river to do some work. He and his wife were both Christians from
                Luebo. They had a Tshiluba Bible and a hymnbook, also copies of the
                Lumu Lua Bena Kasai. They gathered people together on Sundays and as
                best they could they told the Gospel story, and sang hymns. The woman
                said she cared so much for the Lumu Lua Bena Kasai that she slept with
                it under her pillow. We were much thrilled by this story. Many of our
                papers went to out-of-the-way places. The firm assurance that those
                printed pages were witnessing to the saving grace of Jesus Christ enabled
                me to carry on through long and weary hours of work, through fair weather
                and foul. </p>
            <h3>African Artist.</h3>
            <p>One of the ladies
                at Mutoto station told me about a boy there who could draw. He had
                been given a photograph of some missionary children, and made a drawing
                that was so good that the father recognized the likeness of his own
                children. I told Miss Edwards that we would very much like to have
                him at the Mission Press. She said he was too young to leave home.
                I urged that she help him as much as possible so as to prepare him
                to come to us later. She did this, and when she left Mrs. Miller continued
                to help him. Some time later he came to the Press as the artist on
                our staff. Tumba took criticism well, and it was a pleasure to have
                him around. He started making line drawings for Bible pictures, also
                other drawings, for the Lumu Lua Bena Kasai. I made negatives, and
                the engraver made zinc plates for printing the pictures. </p>
            <h3>Course in Photography.</h3>
            <p><a href="Pictures/rc16.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/rc16.jpg" align="right"></a>I believed
                in using
                pictures. I had made some pictures for use during our furloughs. But
                we wanted better pictures for the Lumu Lua Bena Kasai. Once I looked
                at a photo of Luebo Church made by Mr. Robertson, and wondered why
                it looked so much better than mine. The explanation was that his pictorial
                composition was so much better. When I read of a correspondence course
                in journalistic photography, I felt I needed it. Though we could not
                afford it I paid the price and took the course. It proved to be a good
                investment, helping me in a number of ways. From that time on my pictures
                were in demand at our home office, as well as on the field. Numbers
                of my photographs appeared in our Church papers through the years.
                But the course also developed my appreciation of what I saw around
                me. </p>
            <p>What I saw round about
                me kept changing. For years our home was at such distance from the
                Press that I had a nice walk six times a day. For a few years I was
                noticing what I privately labeled my palm tree gardens. Oil palms flourished
                in the Luebo soil. These beautiful palms lined the paths on my way
                to work. I enjoyed the palms themselves (that reminds me that our Africans
                do not think of the palm as a tree). Wind and weather deposited rich
                soil between the old leafstems and the trunk. <a href="Pictures/hm2.jpg" target="_blank"><img
                        src="IMAGES/hm2.jpg" align="right"></a>The
                wind or the birds
                planted seeds, so that beautiful ferns and tiny flowering plants of
                various kinds brightened the sides of the palms. In the course of months
                I had much pleasure in observing these tiny gardens, which seemed to
                be put there for my personal enjoyment. Then for many months I was
                watching the clouds. There are many beautiful clouds in the tropics,
                ever changing, and they fascinated me for a long time, and still do.
                With beautiful trees and flowers and clouds my mind was often refreshed
                as I took my little walks, largely as a result of some training in
                photography. </p>
            <h3>Hymnbook.</h3>
            <p>During my first term
                at the Press we began a project which took us ten years. It was the
                production of a Tshiluba hymnbook with music. Gospel singing is one
                of the most effective methods of spreading the Word of Life. For many
                years the Press had been printing hymnbooks in word editions, adding
                new hymns from time to time. These hymns were being sung by thousands
                of people in hundreds of villages all over the country. They were taught
                on the stations and in the Bible School, then in the village schools.
                But the ladies who played the organs in our Churches had a hard time
                keeping up with the various hymnbooks containing the music. Often they
                had to carry a Tshiluba hymnbook with words, and from one to three
                hymnbooks with music, when they went to Church. Some had their own
                rather clumsy scrapbooks with hymns clipped from hymnals, and Tshiluba
                words pasted in. All of these were unsatisfactory. I wanted to do something
                to help them. As a sort of hobby I started to make photo-engravings
                of hymns with music and the Tshiluba words. It was understood that
                during furlough I would try to improve my knowledge of photoengraving.
                So after I was in America I received a letter asking whether, while
                practicing, I could etch some hymns that could be used on the field.
                Mr. McMurray took more than 200 hours of his precious time to make
                drawings of 32 hymns, with Tshiluba words printed in, all done double
                size for reduction in making the negatives. These reached me in due
                time. My good friend Mr. Raymer agreed for me to work in his own little
                shop near his house. I had just started work on the hymns, and one
                night left the suitcase containing the music drawings in his shop when
                I went to my lodgings. When I rose in the morning my landlady said
                she had bad news. Mr Raymer's shop had burned down that night. I was
                very sorry for his sake and for mine, and also for losing all that
                painstaking work Mr. McMurray had done. I went to the shop to look
                things over. The frame building was destroyed, with much of the equipment.
                Looking for the suitcase we found the steel frame with the ashes in
                the bottom. Stirring in the ashes with a stick, I was surprised that
                many of the cards with hymn drawings had not been burned. Some were
                entirely burned, some in part. But sixteen hymns were intact, though
                burned around the margins. It was decided to have these done at a professional
                engraving shop before anything else happened, and this was done. So
                half of Mr. McMurray's work was salvaged. </p>
            <p>On our return to Luebo
                we tried to get on with the job of making the drawings and producing
                our own plates. It will be recalled that these were depression years,
                and money was very scarce. We were pinched for funds in all departments.
                So if we wanted a music hymnal we had to do it at Luebo. </p>
            <p>It was found that
                our artist Tumba, who also had musical talent, had learned to play
                both organ and piano. He could make music drawings, and thus save much
                missionary time. Besides his work as Press artist, he was employed
                making these drawings of the music. The printers set up and printed
                the words to be pasted between the lines of music, then ready to be
                photographed. By this time Kabongo had a helper in line etching. I
                made the music negatives, they printed them on zinc and etched them.
                Our work went very slowly because I had so many other irons in the
                fire. By working as best we could for ten years we finally printed
                240 hymns with music in our hymnbook. The book has been reprinted a
                few times. We feel rewarded for all our efforts because hundreds of
                natives have learned to sing by note, and are able to teach others.
                Many Africans have wonderful voices and love to sing. Under the talented
                instruction of Mr. McMurray at the Bible School there has been great
                improvement in hymn singing throughout the Mission. Dr. Fulton is reported
                to have said, "Many of these Africans will sing, themselves into the
                Kingdom." </p>
            <h3>More about Tumba., </h3>
            <p>Having again mentioned
                our artist I might as well tell the rest of his story, some of it
                going beyond our fourth term and into the fifth. He was with the Press,
                I suppose, eight or ten years. More and more I depended on him for
                drawings to be used in the Lumu Lua Bena Kasai, in school books, and, in
                other ways, besides the music drawing which was slow and exacting work.
                Mr. McKee had translated Pilgrim's Progress into Tshiluba. He had found
                a Swiss translation which carried many small illustrations. We obtained
                permission to adapt these for our own use. In this way Pilgrim's Progress
                was illustrated with drawings of African characters throughout. John
                Bunyan might have been surprised to see what some of his characters
                looked like. </p>
            <p>Other drawings by
                Tumba have been used through the years, and I suppose are still in
                use. He rendered a service of permanent value. </p>
            <p>But Tumba, while he
                was one of my best helpers and one of my best friends, was also my
                greatest worry. He came from a Christian home, was highly talented,
                and had refined sensibilities. His personality compared to the average
                of his people somewhat as a spirited Arabian race horse might compare
                to a Belgian dray horse. But he was temperamental, as artistic people
                sometimes are. Here was my problem. He and I got along just fine, and
                understood each other. But he often got in trouble with other natives.
                I think it was partly that they recognized that he was gifted above
                their class, and were jealous of his superior talents. Whatever the
                reason, he got into trouble here and there. I highly appreciated his
                skill, and did not want to lose him. But things reached such a state
                for some years, that when I sat at home reading in the evening, and
                heard a quiet cough on the porch, I feared it must be Tumba come to
                tell me he was in trouble again. I shall enumerate only a few of his
                many troubles. Once a boy attacked him with a knife. Tumba had been
                giving music lessons to a mulatto girl, and sat on the same bench with
                her at the piano. The brother of Tumba's assailant was engaged to this
                girl, so he felt it was his brotherly duty to get rid of Tumba. Most
                other scrapes were less serious, but always they worried me, and took
                some of my time and energy. Once it was reported that a man nearly
                shot Tumba, when he found him staring into the family bedroom at midnight.
                Tumba claimed that he just happened to pass by on his way home. But
                it took real begging to save himself from the wrath of the man with
                the gun. </p>
            <p>We found an assistant
                artist who had much talent, and was a great help. He died later with
                tuberculosis. A third talented boy was found, and Mrs. Wilds gave him
                some art lessons. When he reached the stage where I could employ him,
                I sent him to the hospital for a physical check-up. Dr. Stixrud in
                looking at some of the boy's papers found that he had been practicing
                quite skilfully to forge the signatures of some of the missionaries.
                So it seemed unwise to employ him. So Tumba remained our mainstay in
                the art department, and I feared lest one palaver too many would take
                him from us. Finally it came. Tumba had married, had a new hut, and
                a baby came to bless their home. I had hoped his troubles were over.
                But I was mistaken. </p>
            <p>One day Dr. Martin
                told me that either my man Tumba was a bad man, or he was crazy. He
                reported that the night before there had been excitement in the village.
                A man had been seen lurking in the shadows of some palm trees a mile
                from Tumba's home, staring at a hut occupied by three unmarried girls.
                It was bright moonlight. Someone challenged the peeping Tom, and he
                jumped out of the shadows and ran for his life. A wild chase ensued,
                and as the pursuers were passing through the street of the Bakwa Kalonshi,
                the man was caught. It was none other than our Press artist Tumba. </p>
            <h3>The thing must stop.</h3>
            <p>The Press could not
                compromise its good name even for a skilled artist. So I let Tumba
                go, with great sorrow in my heart. We never found his equal, so our
                work suffered accordingly. </p>
            <h3>New Building. </h3>
            <p>Our work was growing.
                I needed a better office for my own work, and for our shipping department.
                We also needed a large termite-proof room for storing books and paper.
                So the money was secured and a new building planned. Mr. Hugh Wilds
                kindly agreed to make the bricks and erect the building. There was
                to be a roomy office for me, away from the noise of the presses, also
                an office for our copyist and shipping clerk Mukendi, and a shipping
                room. The large stock room was to have a cement floor. All book and
                paper stocks were to be stored on shelves suspended from heavy overhead
                beams. There was to be eight-inch clearance between all shelves and
                the side walls. With the clear floor space and clear side walls one
                could inspect the whole large room in three minutes to make sure the
                termites were not starting anything. So far as I know none of the stock
                in that room has ever been touched by termites. And if you know your
                African termites, and their appetite for paper, you will know that
                is remarkable. (One of the missionaries told me that termites started
                on his commentaries and ate right along until they came to the doctrine
                of predestination. That was too much for them. ) </p>
            <h3>Central School. </h3>
            <p><a href="Pictures/61.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/61.jpg" align="right"></a>During these
                years
                our daughters were at our school for children of missionaries at Lubondai,
                about 180 miles from Luebo. Those unfamiliar with the history of Congo
                Missions can hardly appreciate what that school meant to us. When we
                went to Congo it was the common practice for missionaries to leave
                their children in the homeland on the first furlough after their birth.
                On some Congo Missions that is still the custom. But our missionaries
                felt strongly that they were responsible for the rearing of their children,
                and must keep in touch with them. So a small school was started, and
                grew to about fifty students from fourth grade through high school.
                All faculty members are college graduates, and most of them volunteer
                for one three-year term. An excellent succession of consecrated teachers
                has been an inspiration to our children and a great comfort to their
                parents. The school is integrated with the American school system so
                that children can spend the furlough year in their proper grade in
                America, and return to fit into their own class at Lubondai. When they
                graduate from Central School they are ready for college in America.
                No family has profited more from the establishment of this school then
                we have. Our three children received their basic education there, and
                loved it. Both by teaching the children and by releasing their mothers
                for other forms of missionary work the Central School teachers have
                made a very important contribution to the Lord's work in Congo. </p>
            <p><a href="Pictures/fm4.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/fm4.jpg" align="right"></a>It should be
                explained
                that the first three grades are taught on their home stations, usually
                by their mothers, but sometimes by others. Mignon, having been a teacher
                before our marriage, taught our own children these three grades, and
                also taught children of other families so the mothers could be released
                for other work. </p>
            <p>The school year at
                Lubondai consisted of two terms of 4 months each, with six-week vacations.
                Thus the parents could be with their children twice a year. We rarely
                saw our children except at vacation time. During one of the vacations
                of Central School, we usually took our one-month vacation with them
                at Lake Munkamba, a beautiful lake in the heart of our Mission's territory.
                Here our children, like most of the children of the Mission, learned
                to swim well, and spent much time in the water. <a href="Pictures/rc26.jpg" target="_blank"><img
                        src="IMAGES/rc26.jpg" align="right"></a>Most Congo waters have
                hippos and crocodiles to make bathing hazardous. But Munkamba is a
                safe and quiet place, and the water is free of the germs of tropical
                diseases which are all too common in Central Africa. </p>
            <h3>Car on Fire. </h3>
            <p>Once we were returning
                with the girls from Central School in a Model A Ford sedan. The road
                was very dry. We came to a place in the forest about 100 miles from
                home where the road up a steep grade had been dug up, and was little
                more than a deep bed of sand. Running into the sand, the motor stalled.
                Trying to start I must have flooded the carburetor. Time after time
                I tried and failed to start. With embarrassment I agreed for Mignon
                and the girls to get out and push. As she got out Mignon announced
                that there was fire under the hood. Cutting off the gasoline flow from
                tank to carburetor, I got out and opened the hood. Sure enough, the
                carburetor was burning. It has been my only experience of the sort,
                and I didn't know what to do. As nothing else was available we threw
                handfuls of sand on the fire and put it out. I have been told since
                that we could have found nothing better. We looked around and found
                a small underbrush fire in the dry forest, close to the car. We concluded
                that when the carburetor flooded, fumes of our gasoline had connected
                with the forest fire which then flashed back to the carburetor. We
                were so thankful none of us was bummed. However I feared the car would
                not run, with home a hundred miles away. <a href="Pictures/rc14.jpg" target="_blank"><img
                        src="IMAGES/rc14.jpg" align="right"></a>To
                our great surprise and
                delight the motor started, and when we got out of the sand we drove
                right on home. </p>
            <p>But furlough time
                came, and our girls had to say goodbye to Central School and to Congo.
                They loved the land of their birth and would have wished they could
                get their college education at Lubondai. </p>
            <h3>End of Fourth Term. </h3>
            <p>The five years were
                tilled with hard but rewarding work. The output of hymnbooks, catechisms,
                Bible commentaries, school books and periodicals was growing, and it
                was quite clear that we needed more equipment. The Mission authorized
                me to try to find the money and buy this equipment during furlough.
                So we left for America with high hopes. </p>
