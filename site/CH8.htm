  <h2>FIFTH TERM IN CONGO-Continued </h2>
  <h3>Sinking of the Zam-Zam. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>It might seem that
      Hitler's sinking of an Egyptian steamer in the middle of the Atlantic
      Ocean had nothing to do with an American missionary couple in Central
      Africa, especially because at that time America was not at war. But
      the sinking of the Zam-Zam by a German raider changed the whole course
      of our lives. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'><a href="Pictures/af4.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/af4.jpg" width="300" height="401" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>We were tired, and
      needed the furlough which was due. Then too we wished to see those
      girls in America. Mr. Kirk Morrison,� who had handled my work so well
      during our previous furlough, was selected to carry on when we went
      on furlough in 1941. But in the midst of our preparations we heard
      on the radio that the Egyptian steamer Zam-Zam had been sunk by the
      Germans. A number of our missionaries, including the Kirk Morrison
      family, were aboard that ship. We listened anxiously for further news,
      but it was slow coming. It was some weeks before we learned that the
      passengers on the Zam-Zam had been rescued by the attackers and carried
      to a port in France. Still later we learned that our people, instead
      of coming out to help us, as they wished to do, were being returned
      by Government order to the United States. Then, when we were all packed
      up for furlough, with bookings all made from Congo to Capetown to New
      York, and we were actually within four days of departure with other
      families of our Mission, we received a cablegram reporting that no
      missionaries were coming out for an indefinite period. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>We were faced with
      the necessity for a sudden decision. We were free to go on a much-needed
      furlough. But we were sure that � if we left it would mean real damage
      to the work of the Press. Some� missionary who already had too much
      work would have to take over the Press as a sideline, the skilled men
      would become discontented and go to accept jobs where they could readily
      multiply their income, and from which I could not lure them back after
      furlough. I had put the best of my life into that Press organization.
      If it broke up I could not rebuild it in ten years. So it was my opinion
      that if we left it would set the Press back by ten years, which would
      be a great loss to the cause of Christian literature. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>We asked the advice
      of the missionary group, but they were not willing to assume the responsibility
      of advising us either to go or to stay. The decision must be strictly
      our own. We prayed earnestly for guidance and carefully faced the alternatives.
      If we went on furlough, we were risking the future of the Press. If
      we stayed, we were risking our own health, for we were very tired.
      We loved that Press, and Mignon loyally stayed with me in the decision
      to remain with the Press and do what we could as long as we could,
      and leave our personal future in the hands of the Lord. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Then came Pearl Harbor,
      and America was in the war. By and by we might have gone on furlough,
      but it was impossible to secure ocean passage. The years added to that
      term did indeed leave their mark on our health, so after two additional
      years at the Press, it was necessary to give up the work we loved.
      After one more term in Congo doing other work, we had to be retired
      from the work in Africa by the Mission Board's physician. All that
      was a result of the sinking of an Egyptian steamer in mid-Atlantic.
      But in spite of the disappointing consequences to ourselves, we have
      always been glad we stayed at our work in 1941, for the Lord raised
      up capable help to take over, and the Press was saved. </span></p>
  <h3>Vacation.</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>It was decided that
      we must take a little vacation before we resumed our work. So we decided
      to visit our neighbors of the Congo Inland Mission, which had a number
      of stations beyond the Kasai River. We had often had their missionaries
      in our home, but had always been too busy to visit them. We borrowed
      a car and started off for a series of visits which we have always remembered
      with pleasure. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>On one of those stations
      we met two unmarried ladies who lived together, and were very much
      devoted to each other. One day in conversation we were told that they
      were very much of one mind. They never had a difference of opinion
      but could be settled in one of three ways: either by the Bible, or
      the dictionary, or the Montgomery Ward catalogue. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Our itinerary took
      us through the diamond mining capital Of Tshikapa. We had known many
      of their people, but had never visited this place in all our years
      in Congo. We had friends there� with whom we spent the night. It was
      a neat town with many modern conveniences. One thing that interested
      us was that at a number of places the streets of beautiful screened
      gravel were being dug up. We learned that this fine gravel had come
      years before from the diamond mines, after being picked over for diamonds.
      Now a new process recovered the diamonds more efficiently. So they
      were running the gravel through the new process. It was profitable,
      for they could count on a fair number of diamonds for every cubic yard
      of gravel handled. I had long looked forward to walking the streets
      of gold in a better world, but never dreamed of walking on diamond
      streets in this world. </span></p>
  <h3>Back to Work.</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>We returned somewhat
      refreshed to our home at Luebo, to unpack our things and resume our
      work. We had lived in that brick, cement-floored, metal-roofed house
      four years, and had not been troubled by termites. But when we brought
      down our trunks from the garret we found that termites had gone upstairs� through
      the mud mortar of the cement-pointed brick walls, and� made inroads
      on the contents of our trunks. If the things had stayed� there through
      a year's absence much damage would have been done.� </span></p>
  <h3>Welcome Help. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>We carried on our
      work until the November Mission Meeting, which was held that year at
      Luebo. Winifred, older daughter of Dr. Kellersberger, was now Mrs.
      Lachlan Vass. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>One day she told me
      she believed her husband would like the work at the Mission Press.
      As he was in bed with a bad fever we could not ask him at once. As
      he recovered we learned that he would be glad to come, so the Mission
      appointed him to come to help with the Press. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Both Mr. and Mrs.
      Vass are highly talented people. He learned the work at the Press in
      a surprisingly short time. This greatly, pleased me because I was too
      tired mentally and physically to give him the assistance he should
      have had. He did so well that in the spring of 1942, when it was impossible
      to get passage to America, it was decided to send us to Johannesburg,
      South Africa. Mignon needed some X-ray work which could not be had
      in Congo at that time. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The Vasses were second
      generation missionaries. Her father was Dr. Kellersberger, whose hospital
      I built during our second term. Mr. Vass� father had served a number
      of years on the Mission long ago, was captain of the Mission steamer
      Lapsley, and when on the station he was in charge of the then little
      Mission Press. One of his employees there was the elder Mandungu, who
      helped me all my years at the Press, and was still there as a link
      between the Vasses, father and son, over the years, when Lachlan Junior
      took over from me. </span></p>
  <h3>South Africa.</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>We started on the
      long railroad journey via Elisabethville, Buluwayo, and Mafeking, to
      Johannesburg. We learned that we could stay at Brook House, Pretoria,
      a notable rest home for missionaries, and commute to Johannesburg when
      necessary. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>X-rays showed that
      Mignon's ulcer was already beginning to heal. She was put on a diet.
      We were to spend three months in South Africa. We stayed two months
      very happily at Brook House, meeting missionaries from a number of
      African countries who were unable to take regular furloughs on account
      of the war. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Those were dark days
      for South Africa. During those few months Tobruk (on the Mediterranean)
      fell to the Germans, and it seemed as if the whole of Africa might
      fall into the hands of Hitler. Husbands, sons and brothers of our friends
      had been in Tobruk, and now it was not known whether they were dead
      or alive. The future of all missionary work in Africa was at stake. </span></p>
  <h3>Robbery. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Apart from the war,
      the only unpleasant thing about our stay in Pretoria was that we were
      robbed. One night the robber came right into the room where we both
      slept, and stole most of our possessions, to a value of about $250.00.
      As it was cold, it was specially inconvenient that he took all our
      winter clothes. He got my briefcase containing money, passport, and
      our return tickets for the long journey back to Congo. Christian friends
      in Pretoria helped us out, showing that the people of Christ are even
      now experiencing the answer to His prayer, �that they all may be one.� Fortunately
      the thief did not want anything that could incriminate him, so all
      our papers, including passport and railroad tickets, were found in
      the garden. Detectives checked on the case, but the rest of our things
      were never found. </span></p>
  <h3>Johannesburg. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Our visits to Johannesburg
      were most enlightening. We had not realized that Africa held so modern
      a city. Pretoria too was more of a city than we had expected to see.
      But it is much more South African than is Johannesburg, which in some
      sections might almost have been transplanted from New York. </span></p>
  <h3>Back to Congo. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>After a month spent
      at Port Edward, a country place south of Durban on the east coast,
      we were ready to� return to Luebo. On arrival there I resumed work
      with Mr. Vass until Mission Meeting. At that time there was need of
      a matron for Central School. So Mignon volunteered to become matron
      there for six months. The Mission accepted her offer. The Mission appointed
      me, while making my home base with her at Lubondai, to itinerate as
      much as possible in the territory of our new station at Moma, among
      the reputedly cannibal Basilu Mpasu tribe. </span></p>
  <h3>Working Among Cannibals. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'><a href="Pictures/2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/2.jpg" width="300" height="223" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>The territory of the
      Basilu Mpasu had but recently been added to the responsibilities of
      our Mission. There were slightly trained teachers in something more
      than twenty villages, one station school, and one good sized regional
      school, in the area. I was to visit and encourage these workers, and
      to preach the Gospel. I traveled in a Ford station wagon, sleeping
      alone in the car at night. In the daytime I was always accompanied
      by my cook (our house servants were always men) and by an elder who
      was familiar with the territory and knew the workers. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The automobile roads
      were for the most part good, but narrow. The tall grass stood like
      solid walls on both sides. On these narrow roads one often met flocks
      of goats and sheep which obstructed travel. The car could not pass
      through the flocks, and the animals refused to leave the roads. As
      a result we lost much time following sheep and goats for as much as
      a half mile at a time. In view of the meat shortage among Kasai people
      generally, I felt like congratulating the Basilu Mpasu upon being able
      to eat all the meat they wanted. I was quite let down when I was told
      that public sentiment against killing these animals was so strong that
      a man was afraid to kill and eat his own goat. They said they were
      used� for marriage dowries. But what use are they to the man who gets
      them? Why should anyone bother to keep sheep and goats if he cannot
      eat his own meat? Then they explained that the animals were kept for
      use at funerals. When a man died his livestock was killed and buried
      with him. It was so great a disgrace to be buried without any of these
      animals that men were known to trade off their own children into slavery
      to acquire sheep or goats for their own funerals. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>A school teacher wanted
      me to take legal action to compel a father to return to the school
      his son, whom he had traded off to another village to get some livestock.
      It sounded as if that sort of thing were commonly done. But sometimes
      it is impossible to prove in a court of law what everybody knows to
      be true. It seemed quite certain that nothing could be accomplished
      by law against this horrible custom until a greater number of people
      were Christians and some public sentiment was raised against such practices. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Hearing how careful
      they were to preserve their animals for their funerals I was concerned
      lest I should accidentally kill a sheep or a goat of the flocks blocking
      the roads, and thus invite an owner to take vengeance on me. So I drove
      very carefully. One day I mentioned this to the elder. He laughed and
      said the owner of a goat would be grateful to me for killing it. In
      that way he could feast on his own meat and yet escape blame for killing
      it. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>It was said that even
      a poor man ought to have three animals buried with him, and a well-to-do
      man no less than thirty. A chief might be accompanied to another world
      by as many as 300 goats and sheep. Such wasteful slaughter among a
      people so meat hungry seemed almost tragic. So I made more inquiries.
      It was admitted that nowadays the mourners did actually eat as much
      as half of the animals killed; formerly all of the meat was buried. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The Basilu Mpasu wore
      very little clothing, and seemed to be proud of it. The women wore
      less than the men. While often adorned with beautiful strings of colored
      beads, the women as a rule wore only the merest fragment of cloth hung
      from a string, or string of beads, tied around the waist. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The people love to
      dance away into the night. I was staying in one of the villages for
      a few days. The chief was complaining that the government was always
      calling on his village for soldiers, or for men to work the roads,
      sometimes to recruit labor for distant mines. He had so few people
      left, and they were tired. I asked him whether he had ever reflected
      on what the state officer might be thinking when he spent a night in
      the rest house I was occupying. I had listened away into the night
      to the sounds of drums and dancing. It seemed that any state officer,
      staying in the same place, would feel sure that there remained plenty
      of people, and that they were not tired. People who could dance like
      that until late at night must have plenty of strength left. He looked
      thoughtful, and said he had not thought of that. </span></p>
  <h3>Turume Market.</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'><a href="Pictures/39.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/39.jpg" width="300" height="262" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>The big market at
      Turume is a very interesting place. Here the people come in crowds
      to buy and sell. Here we saw what I supposed was primitive crap shooting.
      Down on the ground the men squatted, and they were so fascinated by
      their game that even the unusual presence of a white man did not divert
      their attention. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>In the same market
      I saw what looked like mesmerism or hypnotism. Two men sat on the ground
      facing each other. The one was looking the other right in the eyes,
      with fixed attention, while the other looked at him just as fixedly,
      and was going through a seemingly endless series of incantations. No
      doubt the second had been handsomely paid by the other to cure him
      of some malady or other, and he was not going to lose the power of
      his cure by looking around at anybody. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>It was commonly reported
      that years ago human flesh was regularly sold in this Turume market.
      But the good old days were gone, and the white man's government now
      frowned on cannibalism, so such transactions must now be carried on
      in secret. But that they are still practiced secretly one cannot doubt
      if he travels long among these people. Day after day, night after night,
      we heard tales of cannibalism. Other tribes had heard so many of these
      stories that while men made long journeys alone in other parts of the
      Kasai, a stranger was dreadfully afraid to travel alone among those
      villages. One man who had traveled alone told that he had been attacked
      at dusk and knocked down and left for dead. His assailants had discussed
      his case, saying that it was so wonderful that today the creator had
      sent their meat so close to the village. They went off to get help
      to carry home their human game. But he crawled off into the forest,
      and recovered enough strength to get to a safe distance by morning.
      By keeping out of sight and avoiding the paths he finally escaped from
      their country.� </span></p>
  <h3>Killed by Cannibals. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The cannibalism was
      not mere talk. Some months later Mignon joined me at our station among
      these people, bringing our houseboy who did the laundry. The Carper
      family also had a few boys from other tribes. One day this group came
      to us excited and frightened. They told us that five miles down the
      road a strange woman from a distant tribe was visiting a relative.
      A passerby saw her lying alone in a field bleeding to death from a
      stab wound in her back. He ran to call help, but when they returned
      the corpse was gone, presumably carried off into the dark forest to
      be eaten. </span></p>
  <h3>White Men's Wars. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>One day I was talking
      to an intelligent chief of one of their villages. He had learned to
      read, and bought a Bible from me. He said, �Years ago we used to have
      wars with other villages. But the white men made us stop those wars.
      Now we hear that the white men themselves are having a much bigger
      war than we ever had. Do you think it might be all right for us to
      begin again having our wars just like we used to have?� Well might
      a missionary blush as he thinks upon the implications of that question. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Those primitive people,
      way back in the remote wilds of Africa, did suffer a great deal by
      reason of the white man's wars. Back in the most distant villages we
      would call for the group of catechumens, only to be told that most
      of the people had left their homes and the cultivation of their food
      crops, and gone off to camp for days and weeks in the forest, to get
      up their quotas of rubber demanded by the government to help the war
      effort. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Each able-bodied man
      was given a card on which was recorded whatever he had produced and
      sold to help with the war. The man who did not have a satisfactory
      report on his card was subject to penalties. This of course was happening
      while the people of Belgium were under Hitler's yoke, and people all
      over the world were suffering inconvenience and hardship. These people
      could not understand what it was all about. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>It was said that in
      a certain village which I visited the chief had called up all the able-bodied
      men of his chefferie to present their production cards. This time a
      European recruiting officer appeared, lined up the men, and picked
      certain ones for military service. This was the draft carried to the
      uttermost part of the earth. One man was chosen and sent away to be
      a soldier. His brother was so violently angry he determined to kill
      the chief in revenge. Someone warned the chief, so he stayed hidden
      in his house and did not show himself. After the killer had lain in
      ambush a long time and failed to see his quarry, he killed the chief's
      mother in order to get rid of the anger in his heart. </span></p>
  <h3>War Dance. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>These people had formerly
      been fierce fighters. Mr. Stegall wanted to get some pictures of their
      war dances and get a recording of their war cries as used when they
      went into battle. He told us about it soon after he made the recording,
      which was made without the knowledge of the warriors who put on the
      program for pictures. After the show was over the men were gathered
      in a large group near the tape recorder. Without announcement Mr. Stegall
      turned on the machine, suddenly breaking forth with the wild, loud,
      blood-curdling battle cries which these same men had demonstrated just
      a few minutes ago. In terror they ran for their lives. It was all very
      amusing when they learned that they had been frightened by their own
      wild yells, which sounded as if some enemy village had made a surprise
      attack. </span></p>
  <h3>A Small Language Group. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The Basilu Mpasu are
      a comparatively small tribe and less closely integrated than some other
      tribes. The language and customs varied from village to village, so
      it would be almost impossible to produce a literature that would satisfy
      them all. In this and other small tribes there is a turning to the
      Tshiluba, a much superior language which is spoken by as many as two
      million people. Our school teaching is done largely in Tshiluba, in
      which we now have a considerable literature including the entire Bible.
      It was translated and has since been revised. It is published by the
      American Bible Society.� </span></p>
  <h3>Overdue Furlough. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Mr. and Mrs. Vass
      were doing excellent work at the Press. They were due a furlough. They
      offered to go to South Africa for a six-month furlough if we would
      relieve them at the Press for that length of time. So we returned to
      Luebo to take over the work. They had already rented an apartment in
      South Africa, and the time of their departure was near. Then, just
      a few weeks before they were to go, I reached a state of nerves where
      I was continually on the verge of tears. It was clear that I was too
      much worn out to handle the job, so the Ad-Interim Committee decided
      that we must go on furlough, and leave shortly. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>This was the price
      we had to pay for our decision to stay on in 1941. But we did not regret
      the decision, for the Press organization had been saved. When we packed
      up to leave I felt sure I would never see Africa again. In fact, I
      was so nervous that I did not want to see Africa again, ever. I had
      taken anti-malaria drugs so long I felt that I could endure no more
      of them. We started for America by way of Capetown. But it was wartime. </span></p>
