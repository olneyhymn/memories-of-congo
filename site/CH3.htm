  <h2>SECOND TERM IN CONGO-1922-1925 </h2>
  <h3>We Change Train and Steamer. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'><a href="Pictures/fm5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/fm5.jpg" width="300" height="475" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>Returning to Congo
      after our first furlough, we landed at Matadi. Our two little girls,
      Alice and Dorothy, did return with us. We spent a day or two with Dr.
      and Mrs. Joseph Clark at the American Baptist Mission. Dr. Clark knew
      lots of good Congo stories. He had a beard. After sitting on his knee
      little Alice came to whisper, &quot;That man has fur on his face.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Our travel agent told
      us we were booked for Monday's train, to Kinshasa. I told him we wished
      to go Friday. He said there was some technicality about the tickets,
      and the change could not be arranged. However, by means of quiet insistence
      I got the booking changed, and we did leave on Friday's train. We arrived
      at Kinshasa Saturday instead of the following Tuesday. Mr. Cleveland,
      our Mission Treasurer at the time, had come down river with our Mission
      steamer Lapsley, to make the arrangements to put her in dry dock for
      repairs. He had expected to sail with us on the steamer Aruwimi. When
      he heard that we would arrive Saturday instead of Tuesday, he changed
      our bookings to the Reine Elizabeth, which was to sail some days earlier.
      Just why I felt so positive we must leave Matadi on the Friday train
      was not clear to me at the time. We might have had a very happy weekend
      with the Clarks. But the reason was clear enough some months later,
      when we learned that the steamer Aruwimi on that particular voyage
      up river, was bummed up with the loss of a number of lives. She had
      a cargo of gasoline. If we had sailed on her this is probably what
      would have happened: At the Basongo landing we three men would almost
      certainly have gone ashore for a walk. Mignon and the children, with
      Mrs. Allen, would just as certainly have stayed on board ship, and
      would probably have been burned to death. To us such things do not
      happen by chance. We believe definitely in the guidance of the Holy
      Spirit, and we are confident that it was He who led me to get a change
      of bookings at Matadi, without my knowing just why. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Our trip up river
      on the Reine Elizabeth was not specially noteworthy, except that we
      had quite a bit of fun. Mr. Cleveland and the AlIens were good company.
      On April 1 we played some jokes on each other. Mr. Cleveland came and
      asked me whether I wanted the native passengers to play with my new
      motorcycle on the lower deck. Naturally I rushed downstairs, only to
      be told it was the first of April. The rest of us sent Mr. Cleveland
      a letter which contained only blank paper. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'><a href="Pictures/in1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/in1.jpg" width="300" height="477" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>The Reine Elizabeth
      did not have enough cabins for all the passengers. A few of us had
      to sleep on camp cots on the deck. My own cot was set up near the family's
      cabin, under a large water pipe which curved over it like the handle
      of an umbrella. Next morning I jumped out of bed in shocked surprise
      when a stream of cold water hit me right in the middle. Crewmen had
      turned on� water for washing the decks, and someone had left this faucet
      open.� In those days there were few white children in Congo, so most
      ships were not safeguarded as they are now. Two cables stretched around
      the upper decks were the only guard rails, so small children had plenty
      of chances to fall overboard. Two open stairways also were dangerous.
      In addition to these two serious hazards, the rudder chains passed
      along the decks, and where they passed over rollers little hands or
      feet could very easily be caught and crushed. One day baby Dot stood
      looking at the cables at deck's edge, and said, &quot;NO!&quot; Next
      she faced to two stairways and said, &quot;NO!&quot; Then she went
      and paid her respects to the steering chains and said, </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>�&quot;NO!&quot; She
      had grown weary of hearing that word every time she turned around. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Their aunt Catherine
      had given the children a brightly colored rubber ball about a foot
      in diameter. They loved it. It was a sad day when it rolled along the
      upper deck, bounced down the stairs and off the lower deck into the
      river. We could see the beautiful, thing floating, mostly above water,
      as we left it farther and farther behind, a pretty plaything for crocodiles
      and hippos. </span></p>
  <h3>New Assignment. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>At Luebo we learned that our family had� been assigned
    to Bibanga station, which was 325 miles of native footpaths southeast
    from Luebo.� I had a motorcycle, a light one. But Mignon and the little
    girls had to travel by hammock. We had a two weeks journey before us.
    After things were packed each morning and the caravan started, I could
    pass them and go ahead to the next village where we were to spend the
    night, and get things� ready for their coming. A guest house could be
    cleaned and swept 1 and the dust settled before the porters arrived with
    cooking utensils, table and beds. We could also make sure of food for
    our porters, and better arrangements all around than if we had all arrived
    together. However it was a long, tiresome trip. Those who travel in Congo
    nowadays can hardly realize what it meant then to travel over the long,
    hot miles. Often high grass and weeds scratched one's cheeks. The sun
    beat down from the sky. The hammock men sang more and more lustily as
    they grew more and more tired.� &quot;Dumba Tuya, Dumba Tuya, Dumba Tay,
    Dumba Tay,&quot; these and other nonsense rhymes were sung mile after
    mile, until they became wearisome to the passengers. But the villagers
    in every village were glad to see us. The coming of a white man was still
    a great event. But the coming of a white lady, with white children, that
    was something to be remembered and talked of around the evening fires
    for a long, long time. The motorcycle was not less notable. At that time
    there were very few motorcycles in Congo. So the people crowded around
    in wide-eyed astonishment at one more marvel produced by the white man
    in his foreign country. They could not realize what such things cost
    in the way of ingenuity and hard labor and teamwork. Of cloth and many
    other things we had, it was said that white men brought these things
    up out of the ocean. I could hear them discussing the motorcycle. Someone
    pointed out that the tires were just like a snake. It was fun showing
    off my new toy to the people. In one village a great crowd gathered
    to watch me. I had a powerful klaxon on the motorcycle, so waited until
    all was comparatively quiet, then suddenly sounded off. The crowd backed
    away so quickly that the mass of the people on one side broke the roof
    of a hut as they backed up against it.� After that motorcycle was worn
    out I put the same klaxon on a bicycle. One of the missionaries said
    I jacked up the klaxon and put a bicycle under it. Anyway it was a strong
    voice for a bicycle. Many times I honked behind a line of natives in
    a narrow footpath and they jumped aside, and then burst into shouts of
    laughter, or at least broad grins, as they saw it was only a bicycle.) </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>One of the problems of the long journey was food for
    the necessarily large caravan. It takes all the joy out of life to arrive
    in a village, eat your own food, then feel that your men who have borne
    the burden and heat of the day must go to bed hungry. So goodbye hammock
    travel. I shall never mourn your going! </p>
  <h3>Lost in the Plain. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>On this motorcycle trip to Bibanga I had the curious
    experience of being lost in the middle of a great grassy plain in broad
    daylight. So long as there is only one path one can only go forward.
    But where six paths converge and there is no signpost one can be seriously
    puzzled. I came to such a point when alone on my motorcycle far ahead
    of the caravan. Some distance away I saw a few people. Unfortunately
    they were scared by the funny machine that said &quot;tuka-tuka-tuka-tuka&quot; all
    the time. <a href="Pictures/af6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/af6.jpg" width="300" height="231" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>The more I called them the faster they ran. They ran through
    the grass, not on the paths where I might have overtaken them. Soon I
    was all alone with the sun overhead and a half dozen paths at my feet.
    Praying for guidance I took what seemed to be the right path. By and
    by I reached the distant village. This plain was uninhabited for many
    miles in every direction, for the lake in the middle of it was supposed
    to be the dwelling place of spirits, and people were afraid to live there.
    (Years later our missionaries began going to this beautiful Lake Munkamba
    for vacations, and later numbers of white men and Congolese had homes
    on its delightful shores. It has no crocodiles or hippos. It is fine
    for swimming.) </p>
  <h3>Bibanga.</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>High on the hills to the east of the Lubilashi River
    one can see Bibanga station long before he reaches it, as I learned to
    the amusement of my hammockmen on my first visit. We were most heartily
    welcomed to the station by the McKees and the McElroys and Miss Rogers. </p>
  <h3>Dr. Kellersberger. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>My assignment from the Mission was to build a hospital
    for the work of Dr. E. R. Kellersberger (who served on our Mission for
    24 years, then became Secretary of the American Leprosy Missions). He
    had served one term with pitifully inadequate equipment. So I was sent
    to build a hospital for him. Dr. Kellersberger is now deservedly famous.
    I recall that we once had a visit by the Commissaire de District. Dr.
    Kellersberger was showing him the spots on a leper's back, insensitive
    to the prick of a pin. The official drew back in horror, saying, &quot;Doctor,
    do you touch them?&quot; </p>
  <h3>My New Task. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The missionaries showed me where the new hospital
    was to be built. It was on a gentle slope draining away from the station.
    The foreign material resources were pointed out: A rough shed contained
    metal roofing, nails, tiles for the operating room, a hand-operated brick
    press, a limited quantity of cement, tools for masons and carpenters,
    and some pitsaws and crosscut saws. It was explained that there had been
    some carpenters, masons, and pit sawyers. But most of these had gotten
    jobs at the diamond and copper mines, or elsewhere. The lumber for the
    doors, windows, ceiling and roof framing was still in trees scattered
    around the landscape. The bricks were still to be made. Was there good
    brick clay? No, not very good. <a href="Pictures/47.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/47.jpg" width="300" height="207" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>It was hoped I could make the bricks out
    of two or three gigantic termite hills down in the valley some distance
    away. The wood for burning the brick was still in the scrub trees scattered
    around the hills. There was no vehicle for transporting anything. All
    transport had to be done on human shoulders. There were two good masons
    to help me. It was necessary to train crews of carpenters, masons, brick-makers,
    firewood cutters, and sawyers. The work at the Industrial School had
    given me good experience in organizing workmen to get things done. I
    had learned from Dr. Morrison one little secret which helped me a great
    deal, in employing African labor. He said, &quot;If I were to send two
    men to cut grass, I would make one of them kapita (foreman) over the
    other.&quot; Unless there is someone on whom to fix responsibility things
    will not go right. So through a system of responsible kapitas the work
    began to progress. Just as largely as possible a quota system was used,
    for the individual or for the group. Giving each man a task for the day
    always gave us the best results. </p>
  <h3>Nyoka, the Crook. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>(Nyoka means snake.) Much firewood had to be cut for
    brickburning, and had to be carried quite a distance. Wood was not plentiful
    in the high grass country around Bibanga; firewood was scarce. However
    there were scrub trees scattered in the grass, and these would do for
    brickbuming. Our firewood kapita was named Nyoka. He was well named,
    for I soon found that he was a crook. He somehow coerced his men into
    working his little farm, somewhere down a valley, in addition to their
    other work, or in place of it. When Nyoka learned that I had found out
    the facts about him he suddenly took his departure and I have not seen
    him since. </p>
  <h3>Extortion. </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>Mention might be made of an itineration among the
    Bena Kalambai. I wanted to see the chief of the village where I was to
    spend the night. He was reported absent. Questions brought out the facts.
    The old chief who was overlord of many villages kept this village chief
    in constant fear. Repeatedly and inexcusably he imprisoned this sub-chief,
    and by cruelty forced the sub-chief to pay him goats and chickens, or
    more women to add to his large harem. People living in a free country
    can hardly imagine the forms of extortion invented by hard-hearted, greedy
    chiefs. I am not an advocate of colonialism, as developed through the
    centuries, for it was motivated too largely by self-interest. But something
    could be said for colonial administration if it were solidIy built on
    the motto of one Governor-General: &quot;Dominer a servir,&quot; that
    is, Govern in order to serve. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The missionary interest is not in governing the people,
    but in the salvation of their souls. Even if the people had had a perfect
    animal happiness, still we must take them the Gospel of the Lord Jesus
    Christ to satisfy the need of their souls. For the eternal, loving God
    who created all men, has not created Africans to live and die like beasts.
    Jesus sent us with His good tidings to all men unto the uttermost parts
    of the earth. </p>
  <h3>You Are Only a Black Man.</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>One time a hut was needed as a lodging for somebody.
    I had no time to look after building it. So I picked a man from the workline,
    and said, &quot;You are the kapita. I want you to gather the materials
    and build a hut at such and such a place. Pick out five men. You are
    the boss. Go build the hut.&quot; By and by he returned and told me the
    men refused to work for him. He explained, &quot;They tell me, 'You are
    only a black man like we are. We will not work for you. We came here
    to work for a white man.' &quot; </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>Most of the men were so ignorant of ordinary mechanical
    ideas that they had to learn everything from scratch. Even a simple door
    knob was too much for them. It was amusing to see a raw fellow from the
    hills go after a job like turning the crank on a drill press. He did
    not understand the principle, therefore he fought the handle when it
    turned to come back at him.The untrained native has no idea of a right
    angle. So while many of their huts are four sided, they are hardly ever
    rectangular unless the builders have had some training. Native villages
    were rarely laid out in squares. The houses stood higgledy-piggledy,
    rarely, if ever, in line.  <a href="Pictures/38.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/38.jpg" width="300" height="167" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>Therefore getting skilled masons, carpenters,
    cabinetmakers and sawyers, meant training men from the ground up. They
    had plenty of native talent, but it had to be educated in the skills
    we required. Here my experience at the Industrial School encouraged me
    to go forward with what might have seemed a hopeless task. Our trouble
    was that other white men also needed skilled help. It was easier for
    them to hire my skilled men than to train their own. As they had more
    money than we had, it was necessary to train many more men than I was
    able to keep. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>Again I profited from my experience by sending to
    the Industrial School at Luebo for a graduate to come to Bibanga to train
    carpenters. Misikabo and I understood each other, and he was able to
    teach and supervise the carpenter shop, so he saved me much valuable
    time. </p>
  <h3>Lumber Problem.</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><a href="Pictures/18.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/18.jpg" width="300" height="230" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>I needed lumber. It was a far cry from the steam sawmill
    at Luebo to cutting lumber by hand at Bibanga. I wished for a sawmill.
    But even if Luebo station had donated theirs to the cause, we could not
    have moved it 325 miles over footpaths to Bibanga. I was compelled to
    employ the pitsaw method which was common in many places in Congo. Trees
    were scarce. True, there were small clusters of forest trees down some
    deep valleys, but the lumber was not usable because the termites destroyed
    it so readily. Furniture or roof framing could soon be turned by them
    into empty shells that would break down. At Luebo I had gotten acquainted
    with nsanga trees. These trees are practically termite proof. But they
    are scarce. Scouting around we found there were some nsanga trees scattered
    over the plains. Usually the tree was found alone, or in very small groups. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>But nsanga trees cannot saw themselves into boards.
    There were only a few sawyers left, and they had little skill or experience.
    I had no knowledge whatever of pitsawing. I could not be satisfied with
    anything less than good lumber. Sometimes on journeys I saw first-class
    lumber that had been sawed by hand. I reasoned that if other men could
    get good boards by the pitsaw method we could too. I felt blue when the
    sawyers brought me boards that were twisted and otherwise showed poor
    workmanship. These less-than-half-trained sawyers couldn't even appreciate
    the difference between a straight board and a crooked one. Investigation
    showed that in marking the long lines on the log with a snapline and
    charcoal dust the long lines were straight and parallel. But by carelessly
    marking the lines on the ends of logs they gave a twist to each finished
    board. A little thing like that meant nothing to primitive people, accustomed
    to building crooked huts with crooked trees from the forest. They thought
    these boards were just fine. But for me with a trade school training
    they were a headache. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>After some time a man came to ask for a job as a pitsawyer.
    He claimed to understand the work. Our saws were in bad shape, so I gave
    him an old and apparently hopeless pitsaw to file. If he could properly
    file that saw it would prove beyond all doubt that he knew the trade.
    He turned out a fine job, and I was delighted to put him in charge of
    the sawing. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><a href="Pictures/21.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/21.jpg" width="300" height="225" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>The men were told that instead of paying them by the
    month I would pay them by the board. They did not want piecework. I assured
    them that while one of my objectives was to increase production, another
    was to increase their pay. Still they didn't want piecework. But I told
    them it was piecework or nothing. They yielded. They were surprised to
    see how much more they could earn that way. But in being greedy for gain
    they became careless of quality, and began to bring in lumber that was
    poorly sawed. When I came back from a journey and checked the lumber,
    it was clear that an object lesson was absolutely necessary.� </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>They were reminded that I had promised them a certain
    amount for each board, only on condition that it was a good board. After
    figuring the value of so many good boards, I counted out the metal money
    in stacks on the table. They saw all this money almost within their grasp.
    Then I explained that I simply could not pay all that good money for
    the poor boards they had sawed. I raked half of the money back into the
    cash box, and divided the rest among them. That severe lesson was effective.
    They recognized the justice of it. They realized that I meant what I
    said, and from then on I got good lumber. More than that, after they
    found that they were being well paid for good work, they stayed with
    me. I soon had <span style='"Times New Roman"'>enough sawyers to cut
    the lumber needed for our work, provided I could find enough good trees. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>For those unfamiliar
      with the system of pitsawing it may be explained that the tree is cut
      down with axes, or a crosscut saw. Then logs are cut, according to
      the length of boards required. A pit is dug, perhaps ten feet in length,
      deep enough to give a man plenty of standing room while working on
      the under side of the log. Beams are laid across the pit, and the log
      rolled onto them. It is then flattened on two sides with axes or adzes,
      and these flat sides are lined for sawing. Then one man stands on top
      of the log, and� his companion stands beneath it. The top man pulls
      the saw up, the under man pulls it down. And so they rip out the boards.
      It is slow work. But working in gangs they can take turns, and keep
      the saw going even while the men rest. Generally speaking, we were
      delighted with the quality and quantity of lumber they produced, and
      they were happy with their earnings. </span></p>
  <h3>Two Big Trees.</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>�Nsanga trees were
      few and far between. Most of those within five miles of Bibanga were
      soon cut down. So George McKee suggested that we mount our motorcycles
      and go scouting for such trees as we might find. We started eastward
      on the winding footpath. We had to ride slowly for fear of being thrown
      from the motorcycles. About six miles east George said, &quot;Hershey,
      there is a lusanga tree over there in the middle of the plain. You
      had better get that one.&quot; I made a mental note of the location.
      The tree stood all alone. Seen from where we were it looked as if it
      might be two feet in diameter. But every lusanga tree was valuable,
      and we were glad to see one more. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>By and by I went out
      to examine the tree. The motorcycle had to be left in the footpath,
      which was quite a distance from the tree. Wading through the grass,
      every step increased the size of the tree. Having mistaken the distance,
      I had totally misjudged the size of the tree. What from a distance
      looked like a tree two feet in diameter, proved to be three times as
      large. Some simple calculations showed that it was seventy feet from
      the ground to the first branches. I looked and looked, for the tree
      seemed impossibly big, something like looking for a cow and finding
      an elephant. There was not only a solid diameter of six feet, but for
      some way from the ground upward there were heavy buttresses which supported
      the lone tree against storms. The section near the ground, including
      the buttresses, was so large that four men could just touch fingertips
      around it. It looked as if that tremendous tree could not possibly
      be cut down and turned into lumber with the tools we had at Bibanga. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>By this time our lumber
      hunger was so great that I knew we must not pass up such a wonderful
      prospect of hundreds of good boards needed for Dr. Kellersberger's
      hospital. The Lord had prepared this magnificent tree for us, and we
      must, simply must, cut it into lumber. The task seemed impossible to
      me, but to our God all things are possible. It was decided to undertake
      the impossible task. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Calling the four men
      who usually cut down trees for the sawyers, I told them to go out to
      the plain some distance from Bakwa Tshinene and cut down that tree.
      It seemed best not to mention the difficulties involved. The men went,
      and being very busy with other tasks, I did not check for a few days.
      It was my hope that after three days they would have gotten a good
      start. Then it was told me that the axeman had not even laid axe to
      the tree. This was vexatious. A messenger was sent to warn the choppers
      to get busy, or there would be trouble. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The reply to that
      message came in unexpected fashion. Next morning the houseboy told
      me that four axes were lying at my door. &quot;Four axes at the door?
      Whose axes are they, and what are they doing here?&quot; I anxiously
      inquired. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;They are the
      axes of the choppers you sent to Bakwa Tshinene. They have quit work.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Why have they
      quit work?&quot; &quot;They say they are afraid to cut down that tree.
      The chief of the Bakwa Tshinene village called them over to drink corn
      beer with him. He told them that if the white chief had sent them to
      cut down the tree, of course they must do it. But something dreadful
      was bound to happen if the tree was cut down.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>�You may well imagine
      that I was deeply troubled. It seemed there must be some native superstition
      about the tree. But I was deep into this problem. It was impossible
      to stop. The hospital needed that precious lumber. My hope lay in another
      gang of choppers, the men who cut firewood for brickburning. The kapita
      Mbelai was sent for, and the following conversation ensued: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Muoyo, Mbelai,
      are you strong?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes, I am strong
      like a tree.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And your men,
      are they strong?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes, they are
      strong like stones.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good. Mbelai,
      there is a big tree out at the Bakwa Tshinene. We must cut it down
      to get boards for the hospital. Can you and your men cut it down?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Certainly, Chief
      Kabemba, we will show you how it's done.&quot; &quot;Very well, Mbelai,
      come here tomorrow morning with all your men, and I will give you salt
      to buy food. Then you can go and stay in the Bakwa Tshinene village
      until you have finished cutting down the tree.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Next morning Mbelai
      appeared at my door. &quot;Well, Mbelai, where are your men?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;They haven't
      come.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Why not?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;They're afraid.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What are they
      afraid of?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Mihongo. They
      say the tree is full of Mihongo.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Mihongo are supposed
      to be some kind of evil spirits. Perhaps devils or demons would come
      nearer to describing them than any other English words. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;But you yourself
      can go, Mbelai?&quot; &quot;No, Chief, I can't go.&quot; &quot;Why
      not?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'><a href="Pictures/af13.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/af13.jpg" width="300" height="242" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>&quot;I am afraid.
      Why, Chief Kabemba, that tree is full of Mihongo. That tree has a word. It  talks.
      The witch doctors go out and ask questions of that tree, and it answers
      them. I am afraid to cut it down.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Mbelai, last
      night I learned that you are not a Christian, that you have two wives,
      and that in other things too you are doing just like a heathen. Mbelai,
      you have a great deal more to fear than what that tree can do to you.
      You had better turn to Jesus Christ, and then you would not need to
      fear Mihongo.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Mbelai would not be
      persuaded. He was really afraid. He was sure he would not touch that
      tree. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Now I was in deep
      trouble. If the strong men accustomed to handling the axe were afraid
      to cut down the tree, how could one expect inexperienced men to cut
      it down? </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>A conference was arranged.
      The pastor of the Church and the elders, the four axemen and the six
      firewood choppers, and two missionaries, were to be present.,� As we
      sat in a circle on the grass, we explained that there really were no
      Mihongo in that tree. The idea of Mihongo was pure delusion. Then we
      showed that Nzambi, Nvidi Mukulu, the Creator of all things, had put
      that tree there for the express purpose of building a hospital at Bibanga
      for helping their sick friends. Therefore the missionaries were determined
      to get that tree, and we would certainly do it, even if we had to cut
      it down with our own hands. We also pointed out that if we missionaries
      did cut down the tree because they were afraid to do it, they would
      become the, laughingstock of all the villages, because the missionaries
      had done what they did not have the courage to do. After long persuasion,
      the ten men agreed that they would cut down the tree. It was arranged
      that the native pastor and I were to accompany them to the tree the
      first morning, and open the work with prayer. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Consequently, on a
      morning soon after this, one missionary and one native pastor and ten
      heathen men with axes went out through the high grass to a tall tree
      that dominated the landscape for miles around. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>With the men in a
      group near the tree, the pastor and I led in prayer. We thanked Nzambi
      for putting the tree there for building the hospital, and asked His
      protection for the men while they pursued their task. Then I took an
      axe and began to chop. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Church officers took
      turns staying with the men every day while they chopped, to strengthen
      their hearts. Day after day they chopped, until the tree was ready
      to fall. The tree was hard. Sometimes the axes would strike into lumps
      of petrified sap. Nothing stopped them, and at last I was happy to
      see the giant lusanga fall with a mighty crash to the ground. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Now, I thought jubilantly,
      the victory is won. With glad heart I gave directions for the work
      of the choppers and sawyers who were to turn that huge tree into lumber
      for the carpenters. They were told to cut a ten-foot length of the
      trunk up near the branches, where the diameter was only four feet.
      Other men dug a pit over which the log must be placed for sawing. Others
      cut a few of the branches to be used as beams across the pit. I left
      word that when the log was cut it was to be rolled onto the pit, where
      the choppers could square it for the sawyers. Then I left to attend
      to other work. Later a messenger came to tell me that twenty men had
      tried to roll the log toward the pit, and could not budge it. They
      wanted 30 more men to help them. So I hastened back to the tree to
      see what could be done. I pointed out that there was no room for any
      more men around the log. However, it seemed to me that the present
      problem could easily be solved. It seemed that by doing a little headwork
      I could impress these men from the long grass with the value of know-how. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>But pride goeth before
      destruction, and sometimes before grievous disappointment. Some men
      were sent to dig a trench at a given distance from the log, while others
      cut a small log to lay in the trench. Meanwhile I returned to Bibanga
      and sent blocks and 1 tackle out to the job. When I arrived I had one
      tackle block attached by a rope to the log in the trench, the other
      one to a piece of rope carried over the big log. This was fastened
      to a plug driven into the far side of the log. When the men pulled
      on the rope between the tackle blocks, I expected the big log to begin
      to roll. But alas for the best laid plans! The men pulled heartily,
      too heartily, in fact, for a tackle block broke. I hastened off on
      the motorcycle and returned with another tackle block. It was put in
      place of the broken one. The men pulled. This time the rope broke!
      ! I rushed back to the station and got a stronger rope. But it was
      a bit too large for the tackle blocks. Here was a new problem. Confidence
      in my ability was apt to drop a good deal below par now. I must find
      a way. The next try was a crude windlass -just two posts in the ground,
      with a long, thin log behind them. Holes had been bored into the thin
      log so that pieces of pipe could be inserted as levers for turning
      the windlass. The pipes were moved from hole to hole as the turning
      progressed. Everything moved according to plan until the rope became
      taut. Just at the moment when the log was about to move the rope snapped.
      All our hopes snapped with it. You will recognize that our situation
      had now become extremely serious. Best I knew the nearest hardware
      store was a thousand miles down river. It would take months to get
      anything from there. There was no hope of help. Returning for a look
      around the station, I was surprised to find an old log chain. When
      this was fastened to the windlass hope went soaring. Again something
      went wrong. Link after link was bursting open. Soon the log chain lay
      useless on the ground. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Now I was face to
      face with failure -bleak, hopeless failure. First of all, failure would
      mean that my employees would think that I could not carry out my plans.
      It would also mean the loss of thousands of board feet of valuable
      lumber that was desperately needed for the hospital. It would even
      mean much more than that. Around the evening fires all over the country
      it would be said that these white men who had come to tell them about
      God the Creator, about Jesus the Saviour, had come in conflict with
      the Mihongo, and that the Mihongo had overcome them. The Mihongo had
      permitted the tree to be cut down, then had shown their power in refusing
      these presumptuous white men the benefits they had expected from their
      hard labor. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Knowing that matters
      of eternal consequence were at stake, I was praying most earnestly
      on the way back to the station. I was hoping against hope that some
      way could be found to move that log. Having already looked all over
      the hilltop, I persisted in searching for I knew not what. As well
      look for icebergs at the equator as to look for more equipment on that
      hill. But at last my eyes rested on some rolls of barbed wire fencing.
      Why not use that? Putting two stakes in the ground the necessary distance
      apart, we stretched strand after strand of the barbed wire between
      them, and finally twisted the strands into a cable. With all those
      barbs it was an awfully rough cable. It looked as strong as it was
      rough. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Arrived once more
      on the scene of action, I had the wondering men put the barbed wire
      cable on the crude windlass. Again they pulled with a will. The cable
      began to tighten. It became taut. Still they pulled. Now something <i>must </i>happen,
      somehow. Happen it did. At last, little by little, the big log began
      to turn. It moved very, very slowly. The men kept turning the windlass,
      and finally that heavy log was rolled onto the pit. I calculated that
      it weighed at least four tons. And did I feel like singing Glory Hallelujah!
      ! ! </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>There was a second
      big lusanga tree. ( Singular is lusanga, plural nsanga. ) It was a
      little larger than the first. It was clearly visible across the 300
      feet deep Mutuayi valley, from Bibanga station. In my explorations
      I had visited that tree. That visit now ensnared me. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Because some of the
      workers were unskilled men, and there were serious dangers in handling
      big trees, the chances were ten to one that somebody would be hurt
      during so long an operation, and that the devils in the tree would
      be given credit for the accident. When our first tree was nearly finished,
      I was satisfied that one big tree was enough, and we must content ourselves
      with sawing smaller trees farther away. The Lord had given us wonderful
      answers to prayer in helping us handle the first tree, and in protecting
      all our men so that nobody was hurt in the whole hazardous job. The
      men knew that I had considered cutting down the Bena Nshimba tree after
      we had disposed of the Bakwa Tshinene tree. Instead of following that
      plan I was sending them to cut smaller trees farther away. Why was
      this? Then a disturbing report reached me. It was said that the people
      in the heathen villages were saying that the white men had cut down
      the Bakwa Tshinene tree, but that the Bena Nshimba tree had more Mihongo
      in it. These Mihongo were more powerful than those in the first big
      tree. Therefore it was said that the missionaries were afraid of the
      Bena Nshimba tree. My grandfather was killed by a falling tree being
      cut down by his own sons. So I had a real dread of a falling tree hurting
      some of the men. But the report then current was liable to do damage
      to the basic purpose of all our work. It was as if the people had said, &quot;This
      man claims to be the servant of the Almighty God, yet he is afraid
      of the devils in the Bena Nshimba tree.&quot; Here was a challenge
      which could not be evaded. Everybody knew the lumber was much needed
      at the hospital. A refusal to cut it down when it stood right across
      the valley looking at me seemed like cowardice and lack of faith. I
      felt a sense of compulsion to complete what I had so innocently started
      -a contest with imaginary devils supposed to be living in trees. One
      might suppose that the men who had successfully cut down one big tree
      would not fear the second. So I called the kapita Mbelai. &quot;Mbelai,
      when you cut down that tree at Bakwa Tshinene, did you see any Mihongo?&quot; &quot;Not
      one.&quot; &quot;When the sawyers cut the tree into small boards, did
      they see any Mihongo?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well, there
      were no Mihongo in it, just as we told you. Now there is a big tree
      over across the Mutuayi. You know the tree. It is the only big tree
      on that hill. It is the largest tree in this section of the country. &quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh, yes, I know
      the tree well.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Mbelai, there
      are no Mihongo in that tree either. I want you to go with your men
      tomorrow morning to cut it down. First come, all of you, to my house.
      We shall have prayer there. Then go over and cut down the tree.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Next morning Mbelai
      and all the men reported at my house. I led them in prayer for their
      protection, and sent them on to their work. Half an hour later Mbelai
      appeared again at the house. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well, Mbelai,
      what is it now?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;<a href="Pictures/42.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/42.jpg" width="300" height="228" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>We want you
      to come over and pray right beside that tree.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>There was nothing
      to do but start for the tree, big, tall, black Mbelai, heathen woodchopper,
      and I, a missionary of Christ.� Down, down, down we went into the deep
      valley of the Mutuayi, then up, up the steep hill on the other side,
      through the high grass until we reached the tree at the top. There
      the choppers waited for a prayer to assure their safety, before they
      touched the tree. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>There with bowed heads
      they stood, while I prayed for them.� This was no formal prayer, but
      a heartfelt petition for divine protection for all these men, from
      all danger. Then I took an axe and began to chop with all my might. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Did you hear
      what that woman said?&quot; asked one of the husky axemen, as I paused
      for a moment of rest. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No, what did
      she say?&quot; I asked, as the woman passed on in the winding path
      through the tall grass along the top of the hills. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;She said that
      the person who started to cut down this tree would die before night.&quot; Since
      I was the man who started the chopping, this news item held more than
      passing interest for me. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;So then, if
      I live until tonight, you will know that is a lie, will you not?&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'><a href="Pictures/35.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="IMAGES/35.jpg" width="300" height="228" hspace="8" vspace="8" border="0" align="right"></a>But these men had
      been with me for months. They liked me and had a concern for my safety. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes, but, Chief
      Kabemba, if you don't die tonight, you will die sometime.&quot; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>&quot;So will the
      rest of you,&quot; I said, and went on chopping. Having chopped enough
      to assume all the risks myself, I turned over the axe, and the men
      did all the rest of the work themselves. After about five days of hard
      work the tree fell. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Those earnest prayers
      for the protection of the men were answered. It was not uncommon in
      ordinary cutting and sawing for a man to be hurt once in a while, either
      by carelessness or by unavoidable accident. I count it nothing less
      than a wonderful answer to prayer that in the eleven months required
      to cut those two great nsanga trees into lumber none of those men were
      injured. For it is quite clear that the heathen people would have credited
      any serious mishap to the terrible vindictive power of the devils. </span></p>
